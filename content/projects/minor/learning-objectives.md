| Vim         |              | For writing python in an effective way |

Cyber:

| OSINT       | X           | Open-source intelligence - (Group project) |

_I elaborate on the major learning objectives marked with an X below:_

## Initial status knowledge
Prior to this semester, I am going to record my knowledge of the above topics.
Because of my previous cyber security specialization semesters, I can conclude that I have a basic knowledge of these topics.
On the other hand, I have no prior knowledge on the above topics. 
so with this in mind I am going to immerse myself in this and make assignments that are going to prove that I have a basic knowledge to these subjects.
