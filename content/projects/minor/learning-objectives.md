_I elaborate on the major learning objectives marked with an X below:_

## Initial status knowledge
Prior to this semester, I am going to record my knowledge of the above topics.
Because of my previous cyber security specialization semesters, I can conclude that I have a basic knowledge of these topics.
On the other hand, I have no prior knowledge on the above topics. 
so with this in mind I am going to immerse myself in this and make assignments that are going to prove that I have a basic knowledge to these subjects.

# PDR 

## Introduction 

This page serves as a reading guide and also as my evaluation of the assignments made within the minor. We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that are made within this. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection on the whole of all the assignments is written how it went and what could be better.

## LO1 – Digital forensics 

My specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. 

What a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. 

### Learning activies

### Technical learning activities

Machine learning and statistical analysis are the technical learning activities which I have finished up to this point. These are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden by knowledge. 

### Nontechnical learning activities

The non-technical learning activities are methodologies about deferent aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can’t do within my professional field.

### Conclusion 

At this point I have already created and fully implemented and documented a number of technical learning objectives. In doing so, I did not have any knowledge of these topics as a starting point, during the execution of these assignments I developed myself and learned a lot about them. 

## LO2

This chapter will address how I developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and meetings with both the group and stakeholders. 

### Project setting

OSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and you name it. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are.  
At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  
The goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and challenging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied when and what tooling is available.

### Contribution

I was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with alliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and that of other

### Conclusion 

Finally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.

## LO3

This chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks, including presenting, interviewing, relationship management, and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.

### Peerassement

Below are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

#### Strengths

- Wanneer je bezig bent met iets, altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering
- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.
- Goeie focus op je werkzaamheden
- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.

#### Improvements 

- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team
- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.
- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag
- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.

As you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.
As you can see, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. 

### Professional writing

For the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English this also helps with my course I am taking to bring my English to a professional level. I have also done different researches like the static research this has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis and research and analyze it. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found from the research. 

### Ethical aspect. 

I have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. 

## General Conslusion 

Overall, I think I learned a lot in this minor. In doing so, I placed my focus mainly on performing machine learning in the area of cyber. I had no prior knowledge of this. Now I have a broad scale of knowledge both technical and non technical aspects.
