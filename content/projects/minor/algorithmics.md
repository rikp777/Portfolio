# The basics for algorithms 
The running time of an algorithm can very with...
- The size of the input
- The content structure of the input
- The type of computer we're using 
- The amount of memory the computer has 
- How the algorithm is implemented 
- The programming language used 

Analysing simplification algorithms: 
1. Analyse without implementing 
2. Worst possible inputs 
3. Ignore unnecessary details 

Time complexity
Independent of the computer

Most essentials components for a computer model:
- [x] Working memory
- [x] Input / Output
- [x] Programming capabilities
- [] Graphics card
- [] File system
- [] Operating system
- [] ROM
- [] Mouse
- [] Monitor
