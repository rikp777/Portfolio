# Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery and investigation of material found on digital devices and related to cybercrime.

Digital forensics is the process of uncovering and interpreting electronic data. 
The goal of the process is to preserve evidence in its most original form while conducting a structured investigation by collecting, 
identifying and validating the digital information to reconstruct past events.

The context is usually the use of data in a court of law, although digital forensics can be used in other cases as well.

## Forensic methodologies and practices
Forensic investigations always go through set steps. 
In some cases, not all steps are necessary to capture evidence. Then simply validation and identification is enough of a dataset.
The main elements of computer forensics are listed below:
- The use of scientific method
- Collection and preservation of data
- Validation
- Identification
- Analysis and interpretation (machine learning / statistics)
- Documentation and presentation

Different law enforcement agencies can only work together effectively if they communicate clearly with each other. 
The investigative team must keep the whole picture in mind and be clear when referring to specific components.
It is fundamental that everyone understands whether a case only needs to be prepared, extracted and identified, or whether it also needs to be analyzed.

## Preparation/Extraction
When the investigator's forensic platform is complete, he or she duplicates the forensic data provided in the request and verifies its integrity. 
This process assumes that law enforcement has already obtained the data through an appropriate legal process and created a forensic image.

After the investigators have verified the integrity of the data to be analyzed, 
they develop a plan to extract the data. They organize and refine the forensic request into questions they understand and can answer. 
The forensic tools that allow them to answer these questions are selected. 
Investigators generally have preliminary ideas about what to look for based on the request. 
They add these to a "Search Lead List," which is a running list of requested items. For example, 
the request may have as a guideline "search for child pornography." 
Investigators explicitly create a list of leads to help focus the investigation. 
As they develop new leads, they add them to the list, and as they exhaust the leads, they mark them as "processed" or "done."

So before I begin extracting the given I have a goal in mind. 

## Identification
Investigators shall repeat the identification process for each item on the extracted list.
If an investigator finds an item that is incriminating but beyond the scope of the original search warrant, 
the investigator should immediately cease all activity, 
notify the appropriate persons, including the requester, 
and await further instructions. 
For example, law enforcement may seize a computer for evidence of tax fraud, but the investigator may find an image of child pornography.

## Analysis 
In the analysis phase, the researchers connect all the items and paint a complete picture for the applicant. 
For each item on the list of relevant data, the researchers answer questions such as who, what, when, where, and how. 
They try to explain which user or application created, edited, received or sent each item, and how it was originally created. 
Researchers also explain where they found it. 
Most importantly, they explain why all this information is important and what it means to the case.
