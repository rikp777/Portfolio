# OSINT

During this semester, we as a group have the project topic OSINT. 

OSIN stands for Open Source Intelligence and includes the method of collecting information and intelligence through public sources.

At Fontys, government trainees and students have to learn what OSINT entails. To keep this subject interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. CTF stands for "Capture the flag" this is a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  

This topic gives more insight what OSINT is and what applications it has this seems to me personally very interesting therefore I would like to learn more about this. 

OSINT belongs to the field of Cyber. 

For the project we are going to set up a CTF framework. This framework makes it possible to achieve goals in a fun way with team members. 
This framework will incorporate all the challenges that our team has developed this semester.

I am going to meet this learning goal by creating fun challenges and working out ethics. All challenges can be found in the CTF challenge platform. 

To create this platform we as a group used the open source framework CTFd. CTFd is a Capture The Flag framework focusing on ease of use and customizability. It comes with everything you need to run a CTF and it's easy to customize with plugins and themes.

Within this plaftorm I created most of the challenges. These challenges vary from very easy to very difficult. because it seemed to me personally very nice to keep a standard theme I proposed this to the group. They agreed to this. Therefore, we chose the theme alien invasion. This also has the advantage that with this we are always politically correct because we do not use names.
