Introduction\nDuring this semester, I would like to learn more about statistics and its application. \nIn doing so, I want to learn how to interpret data, analyze it, and draw conclusions. \nThis by setting up hypotheses and testing them. I would like to learn all this so I can apply it in my own projects. This will also come in handy for my follow-up study \"Data Science\" that I want to follow at the TUe. In the statistics course I will make a link with the Cyber subject by doing an analysis on Cyber related data. \nThis means I'm going to look for correlations between certain labels that have to do with, for example, malware. To show that I can apply the knowledge I have learned, I will analyze a dataset and present the data clearly and above all to people who are interested in it.\nIn order to apply statistics, a thorough knowledge of the mathematical formulas behind the analysis of these data is required. I learn this mathematics by following the course on \"Khan acandemy\". \nBy attending the lessons given by Peter Lambooij, a teacher at Fontys, I will make my knowledge measurable. During the lessons, we work on a project; we have to apply the knowledge we have learned. \nI am going to demonstrate this learning goal by showing the results and outcomes that have been released by Peter Lambooij. The results of the knowledge gained from the subject of statistics can be seen in the research. This research was conducted as a project within the subject of statistics. \n\n## Evaluate\n### Version (1)\nBelow are the results of that were obtained in the unit tests of the subject of statistics: \n\n\u003Ca href=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Ffirst_results.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\"\u003E\n  \u003Cimg width=\"80%\" src=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Ffirst_results.png\" alt=\"First test results\"\u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\nAbove is the current status of the unit tests created for the subject of statistics. The unit tests were taken on the Khanacademy platform.  As seen above, all unit tests were passed with a minimum score of 70% or higher.  Since the workload is very high, it was difficult to keep up with all the material that was given each week. Also, the material itself was very difficult and sometimes hard to understand. During these first weeks I learned what the subject of statistics is and when and what it is used for. I also learned what static research is and the formulas that go with it by making hypotheses. \n\n[Khan academy - statistics-probability](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.khanacademy.org\u002Fmath\u002Fstatistics-probability)\n\n### Version (2)\n\nIn my previous evaluation I showed my results from the beginning to the middle of the course. In this evaluation I have now finished the course and both my project and my khan unit have been evaluated. The given results are shown below:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fsecond_results.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\"\u003E\n  \u003Cimg width=\"80%\" src=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fsecond_results.png\" alt=\"second test results\"\u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n\u003Ca href=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fresearch_project.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\"\u003E\n  \u003Cimg width=\"80%\" src=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fresearch_project.png\" alt=\"research project result\"\u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nI am very happy that I was able to attend this course. It has taught me a lot and has contributed greatly to the continuation of my studies. Even though I find the formulas difficult to apply within real examples at the moment. The remaining weeks of this minor I want to make these formulas my own so that they are engraved in my brain. \n\n## Assignments\n### Research project\n\nConduct scientific research by establishing hypotheses, analyzing and concluding. \n\nThe detailed research can be read in the research document an abbreviated version of this with executable code in also obtainable by reading out the Jupiter notebook. \n\n#### Gibbarish URL makes malware significantly more likely to occur\nH0 - There is no correlation between a specific URL construction and a malicious label.\n\n*H0: Gibberish ≠ malicious* \n\nH1 - There is a correlation between a specific URL construction and a malicious label.\n\n*H1:  Gibberish = malicious*\n\n\n#### Javascript volume makes malware significantly more likely\nH0 - There is no correlation between javascript volume and a malicious label.\n\n*H0: code volume ≠ malicious*\n\nH1 - There is a correlation between javascript volume and a malicious label.\n\n*H1: code volume = malicious*\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n#### Javascript volume makes malware significantly more likely\n\nThe study showed that there is a causal relationship between the volume of javascript loaded and the likelihood of malicious or a rogue site.  \n\n\u003Ca href=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fplot.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\"\u003E\n  \u003Cimg width=\"50%\" src=\"\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fplot.png\" alt=\"plot\"\u002F\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n| count |     mean |        std |        min |   25% |   50% |   75% |   max |       |\n| ----: | -------: | ---------: | ---------: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |\n| label |          |            |            |       |       |       |       |       |\n|   bad |   7684.0 | 584.931481 | 156.729323 | 315.0 | 448.2 | 584.1 | 721.8 | 854.1 |\n|  good | 336151.0 | 114.667426 |  49.144527 |  30.0 |  72.0 | 114.5 | 157.5 | 199.5 |\n\n\n***\n\nRecourses: \n- [Drive by download](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.kaspersky.com\u002Fresource-center\u002Fdefinitions\u002Fdrive-by-download)\n\n***\n# Appendix\n## Mail contact \nAgreement to attend external classes\n\nTo: j.geurts@fontys.nl \\\nSubject: Attending Tav\n\nDear, Joris  \nI am currently doing the minor in Cyber Security. \nAfter this minor and graduation I would like to do the pre-master \"Data science & ai\" at the tue. \nIn order to do this pre-master I need to prepare myself well and I need to take a number of courses in my spare time. \nSo this is what I am currently doing.\n\nThe following courses I need before I can start the pre-master, with an indication of the study load.\nThese courses consist of:\n- Mathematica B - 12 hours a week.\n- (1) Linear algebra - 10 hours in the week\n- (2) Statistics - 3 hours in the week\n- English C1 Cambridge (New 2021) - 3 hours in the week  \n  Optional courses: (1) or (2)  \n  In addition, I also want to prepare in advance for the courses that will be given during this pre-master, these are for example:\n- Logic - 2.5 hours per week\n- Data structures - 2.5 hours per week\n\nMy question; is it possible to master the above subjects through self-study with the theory as given in the pre-master? \nI have been given the material by students who are currently following the pre-master.\n\nKind regards,\nRik Peeters\nSoftware Engineering & Cyber  \n\n*- _Through the following email I came into contact with joris geurts.\nAfter personal consultation he has given permission to attend classes related to the tav course.\nIn doing so, I came into contact with the teachers who teach the tav classes. \nthey have guided me and increased my knowledge_\n";E.readingTime="6 min read";E.twitterShareUrl="https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fintent\u002Ftweet";return {data:[{project:E,_img:ag}],fetch:{"data-v-312258fc:0":{toastOptions:{duration:2000,theme:"bubble"},currentlyActiveToc:"",observer:B,observerOptions:{root:void 0,threshold:0},project:E,_img:ag}},mutations:[["setItem",{item:B,id:F,resource:"comments"}]]}}("text","element","\n","right","td","p","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","th","li","_blank","em",2,3,"h2","h3","nuxt-link","some","\n  ","img","tr","br","statistics",null,"80%","h4",{},"minor_statistics","introduction","Introduction","evaluate","Evaluate","version-1","Version (1)","version-2","Version (2)","assignments","Assignments","research-project","Research project","conclusion","Conclusion","mail-contact","Mail contact","h1","\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Ffirst_results.png","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fsecond_results.png","\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fresearch_project.png","Javascript volume makes malware significantly more likely","\u002Fimages\u002Fprojects\u002Fminor\u002Fstatistics\u002Fplot.png","50%","hr","ul",{})));
