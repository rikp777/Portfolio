It is the simplest method for conducting code reviews and does not necessitate a pre-defined structure.\n\nIn addition to any official code review procedure that may be in place, such a code review may still be done informally today.

However, because business needs necessitate speed and agility, code review must be automated. It can result in faster feedback, higher code quality, and shorter time to production.\n\nCan automated code reviews replace manual code reviews?\n\nNo. Manual code reviews reduce risky high level decisions such as the use of suboptimal architectures. They also support a collaborative culture and peer feedback.\n\nWhile automated code reviews are better than having no code reviews, they are not a replacement for manual code reviews. However, they can make manual code reviews more efficient since they save human reviewers from looking for minor errors such as function naming, spacing or style.\n\n#### SonarQube\n\nSonarQube (previously Sonar) is a free and open source platform for managing code quality. It is primarily a tool for developers to use in order to produce high-quality code.
