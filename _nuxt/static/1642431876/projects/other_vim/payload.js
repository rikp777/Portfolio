I asked, *\"why would anyone ever use this awful editor?\"* Fast forward 4 years, this awful editor is now my primary editor. I've tried editors like *Notepad++, Atom, Intellij and VSCode*\n\nThis semester enabled me to make the switch to this environment. This did not work out last semester because there is a very intensive learning curve to learning vim. \n\nI think a great editor needs to have these three features:\n\n- Extensibility\n- Community\n- Composability\n- Intelligent code completion\n\nVim is what I use because it has all four of the capabilities listed above. Allow me to explain each one.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nIf you've used VSCode, Atom, or Sublime, then you know being able to add and remove plugins easily is an indispensable feature. This functionality is also provided by vim but that's not all because vim allows you to choose your own plugin manager according to your needs. In my environment I use packer. \n\n## Community\n\nIn open source technology, the community is very crucial. As long as there are enough contributing developers, a vibrant community assures continual development and problem fixes. More community plugins, tutorials, and human help are all part of the equation. The Vim community is quite active. It has a reddit page, a stackexchange account, and a number of specialized twitter accounts, among other things. I personally learned a lot from the vim master ThePrimeagen on youtube and twitch.\n\n## Composability\n\nIn addition to extensibility and community, Vim features composability, which I believe is a trait that many non-modal editors lack.\n\nCompo..what?\n\nComposability refers to the ability to combine a set of generic instructions to achieve more complicated tasks. In the same way that you can make complicated abstractions out of smaller abstractions in programming, you can run complex commands out of simpler ones in Vim. Vim contains movement motions and editing operators (there are also text objects, but I won't go over them here).\n\n## Intelligent code completion\n\nIntelligent code completion is a context-aware code completion function in various programming environments that reduces typos and other typical errors to speed up the writing process. Attempts at this are often made by using auto-completion popups while typing, querying function arguments, and query tips for syntax mistakes. Reflection is used to provide documentation and disambiguation for variable names, functions, and methods utilizing intelligent code completion and associated technologies. also for this complexity, vim has several plugins that can support you with this. \n\n# Learning curve\n\nit's not a curve it's a wall, but if you break it you'll earn your geekhood!\n\nIf you use vim all day and make an effort to use it well, you’ll be editing code faster than you did in your old editor within two weeks. Learning vim is like this. At first, you do everything as simply as possible. Then you start to wonder if there are faster ways to get things done, and there are! If you chain those commands together they just work! You bump into things accidentally, or maybe you spend some time in the extensive help files.\n\nThe hardest thing is all the key combinations possible within vim. \n\nThis can be very overwhelming but it is not at all necessary to learn all the key combinations at once with as many as 10 combinations you can use all of vim already!\n\nOnce you are in the eqos system of vim there is no going back just like apple. \n\n## What is Neovim?\n\nButtt..... let's bring neovim in to the picture \n\nNeovim is a community-driven open source project and a fork of the Vim text editor designed to make Vim's core developers' lives simpler. It's an upgraded Vim text editor out of the box, or to put it another way, it's a more streamlined Vim that makes integrations lot easier than Vim. Vim is already the most popular text editor and the text editor of choice for programmers. Consider Neovim to be the Vim editor of the future, aiming to remedy some of the shortcomings of its predecessor. For one thing, building plug-ins proved difficult, and Vim isn't well-suited to current systems. So, Neovim fixes the issues you were having with Vim. Neovim improves on Vim by providing a totally redesigned plug-in architecture, a better GUI ecosystem, first-class embedding support, and more.\n\nDuring my introduction to neovim I found out that neovim and the community were in transition this made the learning process super convenient. This transition took place through the introduction of lua files. A lua file contains [source code](https:\u002F\u002Ftechterms.com\u002Fdefinition\u002Fsourcecode) written in Lua, a light-weight programming language designed for extending or adding functionality to software applications. The Lua scripting language [syntax](https:\u002F\u002Ftechterms.com\u002Fdefinition\u002Fsyntax) is simple but supports a large number of [data types](https:\u002F\u002Ftechterms.com\u002Fdefinition\u002Fdatatype) and operators. Lua is very weel integrated with Neovim, and with LuaJIT, it is much faster than vimscript. If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language with a passion because like I told before its really difficult to integrate. \n\nLet's talk about lua files.\n\nLet's take the following folder structure as an example:\n\n``` \n📂 ~\u002F.config\u002Fnvim\n├── 📁 plugins\n├── 📂 lua\n│  └── 📂 setup_plugins\n|  ├── 🌑 plugin_manager.lua\n|  ├── 🌑 mappings.lua\n│  └── 🌑 settings.lua\n└── 🇻 init.lua (or) init.vim\n```\n\nnvim has no fixed folder structure but I personally find this the most logical structure for my needs. My init file is my main file as with many languages it is the starting point. From here I put references to different sub folders that all have their own domain.\n\nIn my settings I set all preferences like font type colors but also tab spacing. My plugin manager is the place where I indicate which plugins I would like to use within my environment. my mapping allows me to create different keybindings.  \n\nThere are still an awful lot of things you can make especially with the integration with lua files, but I'm not working on this at the moment. \n\nBelow is a link pointing to my .dotfiles containing my configuration of nvim. \n\n[.config\u002Fnvim](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Frikp777\u002F.dotfiles\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fnvim\u002F.config\u002Fnvim)\n\n## How I started:\n\nMy learning process began with configuring a my own vim script.
