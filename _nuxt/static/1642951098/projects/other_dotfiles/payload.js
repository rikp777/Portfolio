This means you will need to have quivalent subdirectory structure in you dotfiles folder so that all symoblic lniks get created in the right place. \n";o.readingTime="4 min read";o.twitterShareUrl="https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fintent\u002Ftweet";return {data:[{project:o,_img:w}],fetch:{"data-v-312258fc:0":{toastOptions:{duration:2000,theme:"bubble"},currentlyActiveToc:"",observer:m,observerOptions:{root:void 0,threshold:0},project:o,_img:w}},mutations:[["setItem",{item:m,id:p,resource:"comments"}]]}}("text","element","\n","p","code","strong","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link",null,"li",{},"other_dotfiles",".dotfiles","structure","Structure","about-gnu-stow","About GNU Stow","h1",{})));
