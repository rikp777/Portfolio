that algorithms are just ways to do things. They’re processes to solve a type of problem. These problems can be complex however, just because there are difficult algorithms doesn’t mean that all algorithms are that complex.\n\nYou can begin thinking algorithmically by breaking the problem down and building the solution up, or by breaking the problem down and building the solution up. As developers, we have a natural urge to start with the solution. However, I would recommend breaking down the problem first and then creating the solution from there.\n\nThinking in small steps to solve a problem takes time. But it will however help us better understand the problem. The better an algorithm is, the shorter the time is to determine that an algorithm is faster, scientists have developed the big o notation later on we go into further detail. \n\nSo, how do you even begin to think about these problems to solve in the first place. To solve a problem you always need data. This data we call a dataset this data gives us the possibility to do an analysis. Can I solve my problem with the data as it is now or should I first prepare this data so that it meets my needs. If you have answers to these questions we can start solving our problem. To begin with, it is useful to grab a small sample of your original dataset. With this sample we are going to work out our algorithm \n\nUsing that principle for our algorithm, if we can get it to operate correctly with one item entry and then with ten, we can probably get it to work with any number of items. You'll eventually test it with a lot more to confirm. This gradual build-up aids you in comprehending the nuances and identifying the problem's subtle traps. During this process you really get to know the data. \n\nThe running time of an algorithm can very with...\n\n- The size of the input\n- The content structure of the input\n- The type of computer we're using \n- The amount of memory the computer has \n- How the algorithm is implemented \n- The programming language used \n\nIt often occurs that during an algorithm it is necessary to sort or search for data. For these functions several already existing algorithms / data structures have been developed. Some very well-known algorithms are:\n\n Searching:\n\n- Linear search\n- Binary search\n\nSorting:\n\n- Insertion sort\n- Selection sort\n- Bubble sort\n- Heapsort \n- Merge sort \n- Quick sort\n- Radix Sort\n\nData structures elements: \n\n- Array n dimensional & Strings\n- Boolean\n- Trees \n- Tuple & Sets \n- Hashmap and hashtable\n- Linked List \n- Stack and Queues \n\nThankfully, you’ll probably never have to actually implement any of these algorithms as a professional developer. These days, the most efficient search and sort algorithms are provided in standard libraries that come with most languages. But still it is important for you to know how to use one and what the advantages and disadvantages are. \n\n## What makes a good algorithm\n\n### Correctness\n\nSometimes a algothim does not give you a correct answer or the best answer because the only perfect algorithms that we know for those problems take a really, really long time. Fore example lets say we want a programm that would determine the most effiecient oute for a truck that delivers packages. staring and ending the day at a depot. It would take weeks to run to going through all the possibilites. But if we're okay with a program that would determine a route that goed but maybe not the best. Then i could run in seconds in some cases, good is good enough.\n\n### Efficiency \t\n\nAsymptotic analysis allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular pogramming laungauage or handware. \n\n## Asymptotic notation\n\nLet's think about the running time of an algorithm more carefully. We use a combination of two ideas. First, we determine how long the algorithm takes, in terms of the size of its input. So we think about the running time of the algorithm as a function of the size of its input. The second idea is that we focus on how fast this function grows with the input size. We call that the rate of growth of the running time. To keep things manageable, we simplify the function to distill the most important part and cast aside the less important parts.\n\nWe'll see three forms of it: **big-Θ** notation, **big-O** notation, and **big-Ω** notation.\n\n### Big-Θ notation\n\nWhen we use **big-Θ** notation, we're saying that we have an asymptotically tight bound on the running time. \"Asymptotically\" because it matters for only large values of **n**. \"Tight bound\" because we've nailed the running time to within a constant factor above and below.\n\n### Big O notation\n\nBig-O notation is used by programmers to compare and measure the performance of algorithms. Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It is a good practice for software engineers to understand in-depth as well. The big O notation gives a strong statement about the worst-case running time. We use big-Θ notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below. Sometimes we want to bound from only above. Because big-O notation gives only an asymptotic upper bound, and not an asymptotically tight bound, we can make statements that at first blush seem incorrect, but are technically correct.\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/algorithm/big_o_notation.jpeg\" alt=\"Big O noation\"/>\n</a>\n\n#### O(1) has the least complexity\n\nIf you can build an algorithm that solves the problem in O(1) notation, you are likely at your best possible solution. When the complexity of a scenario exceeds O(1), we can examine it by looking for its O(1/g(n)) equivalent. For instance, O(1/n) is more difficult than O(1/n2).\n\n#### O(log(n)) is more complex than O(1), but less complex than polynomials\n\nBecause sorting algorithms are frequently associated with divide and conquer algorithms, O(log(n)) is a desirable complexity to aim for. Because the square root function can be regarded a polynomial with an exponent of 0.5, O(log(n)) is less difficult than O(n).\n\n#### O(nˣ) Complexity of polynomials increases as the exponent increases\n\nFor example, O(n⁵) is more complex than O(n⁴). Due to the simplicity of it.\n\n#### O(2ⁿ) Exponentials have greater complexity than polynomials as long as the coefficients are positive multiples of n\n\nO(2ⁿ) is more complex than O(n⁹⁹), but O(2ⁿ) is actually less complex than O(1). We generally take 2 as base for exponentials and logarithms because things tends to be binary in Computer Science, but exponents can be changed by changing the coefficients. If not specified, the base for logarithms is assumed to be 2.\n\nyou can write a book about big o notation so much and so big is the subject but for more information I would just google the topic.  \n\n### Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation\n\nWe might wish to declare that an algorithm takes at least a specific amount of time without specifying a maximum time. The Greek letter \"omega\" is used in big-Ω notation. We use big-Ω notation for **asymptotic lower bounds**, since it bounds the growth of the running time from below for large enough input sizes.\n\n# Lets begin\n\nThis chapter will show you how to write a program that will calculate the sum of numerous numbers, or a large number of numbers. It is one of the most basic difficulties that a programmer must address, and it appears in many programs.\n\n```c++\nint main() \n{ \n    double sum = 0;\n    double inputValue;\n    \n    System.out.println(\"Type in five numbers:\");\n    \n    for (double i=1; i<=5; i++)\n        {\n        cin >> inputValue;\n        sum = sum + inputValue;\n        cout << \"The current sum is: \" << sum << endl;\n        }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe running time of an algorithm can very with...\n- The size of the input\n- The content structure of the input\n- The type of computer we're using \n- The amount of memory the computer has \n- How the algorithm is implemented \n- The programming language used \n\nAnalysing simplification algorithms: \n1.

A secure code review does not strive to find every flaw in the code; rather, it seeks to provide insight into the sorts of vulnerabilities that exist and to assist the application's developers in understanding what issues are present. The purpose is to provide developers with information that will aid them in making the source code of the application more sound and safe.\n\nA secure code review concentrates on seven different security techniques or regions. An application that is vulnerable in any way makes it a target for a hostile user and raises the chances of it being used in an attack. A secure code review should educate developers about the source code's soundness in each of the following areas:\n\n- Authentication\n- Authorization\n- Session management\n- Data validation\n- Error handling\n- Logging\n- Encryption\n\n## Manual vs. Automated Review\n\nA secure code review can be either manual or automated, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. An analyst performs a manual review by going through the code line by line, looking for errors and security issues. A tool is used to scan the code and flag potential issues in an automated review.\n\nManual review takes time and requires significant domain expertise to complete correctly. Manual code review can often take years of practice to become efficient. Errors in the review (missed and incorrect findings) are unavoidable even with experienced human analysis. According to the MITRE Secure Code Review Practice, a skilled reviewer can complete approximately 3,000 lines of code per day.\n\nAutomated review aids in the resolution of issues associated with manual review. Good automated review tools, on the other hand, are not cheap. Furthermore, the technology underlying automated tools is only effective at detecting certain types of flaws. A single automated tool may be effective at detecting some issues but ineffective at detecting others. Using multiple automated tools can help to mitigate this issue, but it will still not uncover every issue. Automated tools also have a tendency to generate false positives (reported findings that are not actually issues). Adjudicating false positives necessitates human intervention and depletes the development team's time.\n\nPrevention is better than to cure, and this also applies to software development, which is why it is critical to look for vulnerabilities early in the development process.

It is the simplest method for conducting code reviews and does not necessitate a pre-defined structure.\n\nIn addition to any official code review procedure that may be in place, such a code review may still be done informally today. Over-the-shoulder code reviews have typically been done in person, but distant teams can use collaborative tools to do so as well.\n\n#### Pair Programming\n\nPair programming is a process of continuous code review. Two developers are seated at a workstation, but only one is actively coding, while the other provides real-time feedback.\n\nWhile it may be a useful tool for inspecting new code and training developers, its time-consuming nature may make it inefficient. During the review period, the reviewer is prevented from doing any other productive work.\n\n#### Digital\n\nIf you use [GitHub](https://github.com/features/code-review/) to maintain your Git repositories on the cloud, you may have already used forks and pull requests to review code. In its pull requests, GitHub includes a code review tool.

They also support a collaborative culture and peer feedback.\n\nWhile automated code reviews are better than having no code reviews, they are not a replacement for manual code reviews. However, they can make manual code reviews more efficient since they save human reviewers from looking for minor errors such as function naming, spacing or style.\n\n#### SonarQube\n\nSonarQube (previously Sonar) is a free and open source platform for managing code quality.

Digital forensics is the process of uncovering and interpreting electronic data. The goal of the process is to preserve evidence in its most original form while conducting a structured investigation by collecting, identifying and validating the digital information to reconstruct past events. The context is usually the use of data in a court of law, although digital forensics can be used in other cases as well.\n\n## Forensic methodologies and practices\nForensic investigations always go through set steps. \nIn some cases, not all steps are necessary to capture evidence. Then simply validation and identification is enough of a dataset.\nThe main elements of computer forensics are listed below:\n\n- The use of scientific method\n- Collection and preservation of data\n- Validation\n- Identification\n- Analysis and interpretation (machine learning / statistics)\n- Documentation and presentation\n\nDifferent law enforcement agencies can only work together effectively if they communicate clearly with each other. The investigative team must keep the whole picture in mind and be clear when referring to specific components. It is fundamental that everyone understands whether a case only needs to be prepared, extracted and identified, or whether it also needs to be analyzed.\n\n## Preparation/Extraction\nWhen the investigator's forensic platform is complete, he or she duplicates the forensic data provided in the request and verifies its integrity. This process assumes that law enforcement has already obtained the data through an appropriate legal process and created a forensic image.\n\nAfter the investigators have verified the integrity of the data to be analyzed, they develop a plan to extract the data. They organize and refine the forensic request into questions they understand and can answer. The forensic tools that allow them to answer these questions are selected. \nInvestigators generally have preliminary ideas about what to look for based on the request. \nThey add these to a \"Search Lead List,\" which is a running list of requested items. For example, \nthe request may have as a guideline \"search for child pornography.\" Investigators explicitly create a list of leads to help focus the investigation. As they develop new leads, they add them to the list, and as they exhaust the leads, they mark them as \"processed\" or \"done.\"\n\nSo before I begin extracting the given I have a goal in mind. \n\n## Identification\nInvestigators shall repeat the identification process for each item on the extracted list.\nIf an investigator finds an item that is incriminating but beyond the scope of the original search warrant, the investigator should immediately cease all activity, notify the appropriate persons, including the requester, and await further instructions. For example, law enforcement may seize a computer for evidence of tax fraud, but the investigator may find an image of child pornography.\n\n## Analysis \nIn the analysis phase, the researchers connect all the items and paint a complete picture for the applicant. For each item on the list of relevant data, the researchers answer questions such as who, what, when, where, and how. They try to explain which user or application created, edited, received or sent each item, and how it was originally created. Researchers also explain where they found it. Most importantly, they explain why all this information is important and what it means to the case.\n\n## Documenting and Reporting\n\nComputer forensic investigators must keep an accurate record of all activity related to the investigation, including all methods used for testing system functionality and retrieving, copying, and storing data, as well as all actions taken to acquire, examine, and assess evidence, in addition to fully documenting information related to hardware and software specs. This not only demonstrates how the integrity of user data has been kept, but it also confirms that all parties have followed relevant policies and processes. Because the entire procedure is designed to collect facts that may be used as evidence in a court of law, an investigator's inability to accurately document his or her findings is a major red flag.\n\n\n\n## History \n\nLooking back on the history of digital forensics, it's clear that law enforcement at the time had just a rudimentary understanding of how to apply digital forensic procedures. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, the forensics team was largely made up of members of federal law enforcement organizations with a background in computers. Because most paperwork is done digitally, the first area of concern for law enforcement was data storage. Seizing, keeping, and examining the documents was undeniably a time-consuming task for the authorities. In response to this, the FBI developed the Magnet Media program, the first formal digital forensics program, in 1984.\n\nOther strategies for detecting cybercriminals who break into computer systems were developed as a result. The first honeypot trap was invented in 1986 by Cliff Stoll, a Unix System Administrator at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Due to the proliferation of child pornography on the internet, digital forensics grew in popularity.\n\n## In action\n\nAs you can imagine, ethics are also very important within this profession. You have to work independently without prejudice. For this, you must therefore obtain a certificate to ensure your ethical conduct. Having a degree in criminal justice, psychology, engineering, biology or any other field with no certificates does not mean you’ll never get a job.\n\n### Certifications\n\nSome well-known forensic certifications include the following:\n\n- CISA – Certified Information Systems Auditor\n- CISSP – Certified Information Systems Security Professional\n- CCE – Certified Computer Examiner\n- CFCE – Certified Forensic Computer Examiner\n- GIAC – Global Information Assurance Certification\n  - GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)\n  - GIAC Advanced Smartphone Forensics (GASF)\n  - GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE)\n  - GIAC Network Forensic Analyst (GNFA)\n  - GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM)\n  - GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)\n\nForensic Software Vendor Training and Certificates can also be beneficial.  Some examples include:\n\n- ACE – AccessData Certified Examiner\n- BelkaCE – Belkasoft\n- EnCE – EnCase Certified Engineer\n- Cellebrite\n  - Cellebrite Certified Operator (CCO)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Physical Analyst (CCPA)\n  - Cellebrite Certified Mobile Examiner (CCME)\n- XRY – XRY Certification\n- X-PERT – X-Ways Professional in Evidence Recovery Techniques\n- BlackBag Technologies\n  - Certified Blacklight Examiner (CBE)\n  - Certified Mobilyze Operator (CMO)\n  - Mac and iOS Certified Forensic Examiner (MICFE)\n\nOther certificates you may also consider, that provide a more general computer foundation are:\n\n- CompTIA A+\n- CompTIA Network+\n- CompTIA Security+\n\nCertification courses are typically short courses, often less than 10 classes.\n\nEach certification course has their own requirements and can include professional time spent in a forensics related field.\n\nIt’s best to research each certification you’re planning to take to ensure you meet the requirements before deciding to take it.\n\n### Tooling\n\nIn the 1990s, digital investigations were conducted utilizing live analysis, and it was usual practice to review digital media using the device in question. With the growing use of devices capable of storing massive volumes of data, live analysis became inefficient. Digital forensic tools were eventually developed to examine data on a device without causing it any harm. Digital forensic tools are currently divided into three categories: open source digital forensic tools, hardware digital forensic tools, and others. Most common tooling today are the following\n\n- Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy)\n  - Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy) is a Windows-based utility program that simplifies computer forensic analysis. You may use this tool to inspect your hard disk and smartphone.\n- CAINE\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- PALADIN\n  - CAINE is an Ubuntu-based program that provides a graphical interface to a complete forensic environment. As a module, this tool can be integrated into current software solutions. It creates a chronology from RAM on its own.\n- EnCase\n  - Encase is an application that helps you to recover evidence from hard drives. It allows you to conduct an in-depth analysis of files to collect proof like documents, pictures, etc.\n- Wireshark\n  - Wireshark is a tool that analyzes a network packet. It can be used to for network testing and troubleshooting. This tool helps you to check different traffic going through your computer system.\n- ProDiscover Forensic\n  - ProDiscover Forensic is a computer security program that helps you to find all of the data on a hard drive. It can safeguard evidence and generate high-quality reports for use in judicial proceedings. EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) information can be extracted from JPEG files with this utility.\n\nBut for each solution, you can also find lots of scripts online that were created for specific purposes and made public by the analyst for others to use in their research as well \n\nHere are the main types of digital forensic tools:\n\n- Disk Forensic Tools\n  - SSD\n  - Hard drive \n- Network Forensic Tools\n- Wireless Forensic Tools\n- Database Forensic Tools\n- Malware Forensic Tools\n- Email Forensic Tools\n- Memory Forensic Tools\n- Mobile Phone Forensic Tools\n\nAs you can see, there are a whole bunch of subdomains that forensic analysis can be done on. Each domain has its own tooling to achieve the desired result. on each domain you can apply your own methods to get to the desired result for example I apply machine learning in my own project. \n\n***\nResource: \n- [computer forensics digital forensic analysis methodology](https://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/computer-forensics-digital-forensic-analysis-methodology.html)\n\n- [online.norwich.edu](https://online.norwich.edu/academic-programs/resources/5-steps-for-conducting-computer-forensics-investigations)\n- [encouncil.org](https://www.eccouncil.org/what-is-digital-forensics/)\n\n","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/digital-forensic","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Digital Forensics\nDigital forensics is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery and investigation of material found on digital devices and related to cybercrime.

We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that we made within this group. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection about all assignments is written. How it went and what could be better etc. \n\n## LO1 – Digital forensics \n\nMy specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital Forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. \n\nWhat a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. \n\n### Learning activies\n\n| Task                                             | Status | Pre-knowledge         |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------- |\n| Machine-learning  Enron Dataset                  | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning  Gibbarish                      | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning  seclab                         | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistics  formula’s                            | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistical  research                            | Done   | None                  |\n| Captcha  mechanism                               | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| Digital  forensics methodology                   | Done   | None                  |\n| Course code cyber analysis (Secure code  review) | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Regular expressions “Regex” evil “Regex”         | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| OSINT                                            | Busy   | None                  |\n| GDPR FDA 21 CFR Part 11                          | Busy   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Pentest Methodology                              | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n\n### Technical learning activities\n\nFor machine learning aspect I had to make a model that would detect so-called gibberish. This was part of a statistical research project where I was looking for a correlation between malicious URL's and gibberish. Since there was no open source model that would detect gibberish I had to make one myself. This was a challenge but I managed to make it work. After I got the model working I was able to write my research document for my statistical course. So these courses are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden my knowledge about other topics relating to cyber.  \n\n### Nontechnical learning activities\n\nThe non-technical learning activities are methodologies about different aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of my interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can not do within my professional field.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAs of now I have gained knowlegde in a number of technical learning objectives. I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are.  \nAt Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management, and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.\n\n| ***Description\\***                                           | **Marks** | --   | --   | --   | --   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| *Comes up with  new, original, or usable ideas for the project* | 3         | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Meets deadlines*                                            | 5         | 5    | 4    | 5    | 5    |\n| *Delivers quality work*                                      | 4         | 5    | 4    | 5    | 4    |\n| *Helps others*                                               | 4         | 4    | 5    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Brings up  problems, challenges, areas of concern for discussion* | 4         | 4    | 4    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Has a positive  effect on the group's work atmosphere*      | 5         | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5    |\n\n<style>\ntable th:first-of-type {\n    width: 40%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(2) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(3) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(4) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(5) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\n</style>\n\n#### Strengths\n\n- Wanneer je bezig bent met iets, bijt je je er in vast. Altijd goede kwaliteit oplevering.\n- Works hard on creating new challenges and makes really creative and difficult ones.\n- Goede focus op je werkzaamheden\n- Works hard and shows others what you did. The work you do is always very good.\n\n#### Improvements \n\n- Communiceer gedurende de dag wat meer met het team\n- Mag gedurende de dag wat meer laten weten waar hij mee bezig is als hij niet aanwezig is.\n- Communiceer wat meer op een werkdag\n- Working very hard, maybe sometimes a bit too hard.\n\nAs you can see, the overall assessment is very positive. It is nice to hear that my groupmates think positively of me. This is very motivating to continue developing the project.\nNevertheless, there are also some things in which I can still improve myself. The most important point is communication. The first few weeks, this went very well but due to matters outside of school I was unable to come to school on location for the last two weeks. \n\n### Professional writing\n\nFor the professional writing I chose to write my portfolio in English. Currently I am taking an English course to bring my English to a professional level so writing my portfolio in English is a very good exercise. I have also done different researches like the static research. This has also contributed to my professionalism so I have learned how to set up a hypothesis, do research and analyze the data. In the process I also learned how to draw a conclusion from the results as found in the research. \n\n### Ethical aspect. \n\nI have delved quite deeply into the ethical processes within the topics I cover. I have also done this for the group project. This has taught me how to approach certain things and what things cannot be done within the field and specialization. \n\n## General Conslusion \n\nOverall, I think I learned a lot in this minor. In doing so, I placed my focus mainly on performing machine learning in the area of cyber. I had no prior knowledge of this. Now I have a broad scale of knowledge both technical and non technical aspects.\n","dir":"/projects/minor","path":"/projects/minor/learning-objectives","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Learning Objectives\nThe learning objectives I want to cover this semester (some of which I want to develop for the current minor \"Cyber\") are as followed:\nMathematica\n\n<div class=\"table-one\">\n\n| subject     | elaborate   | explanation |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Calculus    |             | Mathematics |\n| Logic       | X           | Logical proof and reasoning |\n| Sets        |             | Set theory - study and formalization of sets |\n| Statistics  | X           | Statistics is the science and technique of collecting, processing, interpreting, and presenting data |\n| Algorithmics| X           | Algorithmics is obviously about algorithms.

We will focus on 3 aspects as described in the Cyber course. I will describe each learning objective briefly and give an evaluation. I will also talk about the group project and the tasks that we made within this group. I will also briefly show my peer assessment results as I have been assessed by my group members. In the conclusion, a reflection about all assignments is written. How it went and what could be better etc. \n\n## LO1 – Digital forensics \n\nMy specialization that I chose for this minor is Digital Forensics. This specialization is about collecting digital evidence that can show that an organization or person has performed things in a digital environment that are not acceptable. During this specialization route, I am going to look at ethical issues and the different possibilities within this specialization. I will also look at how tooling is used within an investigation. I will also shift my focus to the field of machine-learning and its applications within the cyber aspect. \n\nWhat a digital forensic does exactly can be read in my portfolio. Herein, I map out different topics and techniques. \n\n### Learning activies\n\n| Task                                             | Status | Pre-knowledge         |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------- |\n| Machine-learning  Enron Dataset                  | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning  Gibbarish                      | Done   | None                  |\n| Machine-learning  seclab                         | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistics  formula’s                            | Done   | None                  |\n| Statistical  research                            | Done   | None                  |\n| Captcha  mechanism                               | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| Digital  forensics methodology                   | Done   | None                  |\n| Course code cyber analysis (Secure code  review) | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Regular expressions “Regex” evil “Regex”         | Done   | Some prior  knowledge |\n| OSINT                                            | Busy   | None                  |\n| GDPR FDA 21 CFR Part 11                          | Busy   | Prior  knowledge      |\n| Pentest Methodology                              | Done   | Prior  knowledge      |\n\n### Technical learning activities\n\nFor machine learning aspect I had to make a model that would detect so-called gibberish. This was part of a statistical research project where I was looking for a correlation between malicious URL's and gibberish. Since there was no open source model that would detect gibberish I had to make one myself. This was a challenge but I managed to make it work. After I got the model working I was able to write my research document for my statistical course. So these courses are connected to each other and have a cyber aspect to them. I also did some side project to further broaden my knowledge about other topics relating to cyber.  \n\n### Nontechnical learning activities\n\nThe non-technical learning activities are methodologies about different aspects within the Cyber security atmosphere. I also did some ethical research on topics of my interest. This gave me a broad view of what I can and can not do within my professional field.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAs of now I have gained knowlegde in a number of technical learning objectives. I made this measurable by documenting the steps I took to get to my learning objectives. Before this, I did not have any prior knowledge in any of these topics so I have gained most of my knowledge during the execution of the assignments. It is fair to say that I have created a steady basis for myself to build up more knowledge regarding cyber related aspects.  \n\n## LO2\n\nThis chapter will address how I personally developed within the group project. In doing so, I will talk about the research and tasks I have made within the OSINT Project. I will also talk briefly about the communication within the group and the meetings with both the group members and stakeholders. \n\n### Project setting\n\nOSINT is an important part of the current state of the world. With OSINT, you can find a lot of information that is publicly known. Think about news websites, articles, social media and so on. Since Fontys wants to make their students more familiar with OSINT and the dangers and possibilities of it, we set up this project plan. The idea is to develop a CTF environment where students and government students can gain knowledge on how to use OSINT and what the possibilities and dangers are.  \nAt Fontys, government trainees and students come to learn what OSINT is all about. To keep this topic interesting, a fun and interactive way to demonstrate OSINT must be found. One way to accomplish this is a CTF related to OSINT. Capture the flags are a fun and interactive way to accomplish this.  \nThe goal is to develop a running, stable and reachable CTF system. Users should be able to play challenges independently and these challenges should have a storyline/goal. Challenges are exercises that a user will have to perform in order to learn more about OSINT. Challenges should be fun and encouraging in order to motivate users to learn more. We also need to describe ethics and scenarios. With scenarios you can think of the Bellingcat and MH17 example. In challenges, users learn what tooling is applied, when it is applied and what tooling is available.\n\n### Contribution\n\nI was the scrum leader during the definition phase of the project. This meant that I was the first to define the tasks within the group and then assign them. I also have a big role within the creation of challenges within our platform. In doing so, I made sure that there was a set format and a set theme. The theme has to do with aliens who try to infiltrate our society. It is up to the trainee to track down these aliens. I have also contributed to the research within our group by helping to formulate the research questions. I also made sure there was good communication within the group so that everyone knows what they are doing and the other way around.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nFinally, in terms of my growth as an innovator, I have had experience expressing my ideas in the early stages of project development and sharing them with my colleagues. In addition, I have interacted with clients through interviews, meetings, a presentation, and reports.\n\n## LO3\n\nThis chapter will focus on a peer review of my project skills and feedback from my coach, stakeholders, and other external sources. It will also review and analyze things as well as my contributions to professional writing and communication tasks which include presenting, interviewing, relationship management, and advising. It will also cover the ethical aspects of my professional development as a security professional.\n\n### Peerassement\n\nBelow are the points that can be seen as given by my teammates within my project group.\n\n| ***Description\\***                                           | **Marks** | --   | --   | --   | --   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| *Comes up with  new, original, or usable ideas for the project* | 3         | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Meets deadlines*                                            | 5         | 5    | 4    | 5    | 5    |\n| *Delivers quality work*                                      | 4         | 5    | 4    | 5    | 4    |\n| *Helps others*                                               | 4         | 4    | 5    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Brings up  problems, challenges, areas of concern for discussion* | 4         | 4    | 4    | 4    | 4    |\n| *Has a positive  effect on the group's work atmosphere*      | 5         | 5    | 5    | 5    | 5    |\n\n<style>\ntable th:first-of-type {\n    width: 40%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(2) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(3) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(4) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\ntable th:nth-of-type(5) {\n    width: 12%;\n}\n</style>\n\n#### Strengths\n\n- Wanneer je bezig bent met iets, bijt je je er in vast.

like to learn this as a new challenge to learn more about the techniques behind Machine Learning. \nWhat is it, what is it used for or when to use it. \nI am going to link to Cyber by performing a data analysis on a dataset related to the subject of cyber. \nIn doing so, I am using the \"Eron\" dataset which is specifically used for forensics. \nIn order to apply all of this, I need to learn about the different types of algorithms out there. \nFor this I need Python and knowledge of the types of algorithms out there and when to apply them. \nBy executing and following course on Udacity and the associated assignments, \nI am going to make this learning goal measurable for myself. \nFurthermore, I also want to eventually be able to perform an analysis on the Enron dataset.\n\n## Evaluate\n### Version (1)\nCurrently I am working on Udacity: [\"Intro to Machine Learning\"](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120). \nThis course I have now 50% completed. \nDuring this course I learned about Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees and Regression. \nThe material was easy to understand but at the moment I do not know how I can apply it within my own project/research. \nThe step from theory to practice\n\n### Version (2)\nHere I have been working on building an algorithm that detects gibberish. \nThis was quite difficult because I had no prior knowledge.\nI contacted lecturer Peter Lambooij and discussed how I could best approach this. \nHe suggested that I delve further into Naive Bayes. \nI had a small knowledge of Naive Bayes from the Udacity course but to build the algorithm I needed more knowledge so I decided to delve further into this subject. \nAfter finding out how the algorithm works and its applications I started to build a prototype. \nAfter the prototype, I built a final version whose elaboration is described below. \nDescribing the elaboration was difficult because the prepairing of the data was quite complicated.\n\n# Assignments\n## Enron Dataset\nThe Enron Email Corpus is a massive dataset, containing approximately 500,000 messages from executives of the Enron Corporation. \nEnron was a large American company that was investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2001 after its rather spectacular bankruptcy and dissolution. \nIt contains records of about 150 users, mostly management of Enron, organized in folders. \nThe corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. \nThis data was originally made public, and put on the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. \nIn its raw form, the Enron corpus is a massive collection of folders containing 2.2 Gigabytes of messages in MBOX format, all individually preserved\n\n### Biggest corporate fraud\nBut first we need to know something about the biggest corporate fraud in American history!\nThe Enron fraud is a big, messy, and totally fascinating story of corporate

Here we were given a presentation with the basic principles and techniques. We were then allowed to apply these within the supplied dataset. Because I already did two projects within this field it was not so difficult and it was easy because they used scikit learn. \n\n## Confusion Matrix\n\nWhen you are using machine learning algorithms it is useful to always test your dataset.

The emphasis on privacy is maintained throughout the system's lifespan. The goal is to improve personal data security. This can already be accomplished by considering the necessity of storage: which data are truly required and which are not? Data must be considered throughout its entire life cycle, including storage, modification, and deletion. Organizational aspects, in addition to technical aspects, play a role.\n\nPrivacy by Design is often mentioned in the same breath as Privacy by Default. They are related concepts; Privacy by Default refers to the default settings of a program, website, service or device.\nPrivacy by Default and Privacy by Design are enshrined as concepts in Article 25 of the Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming (AVG).\n\n### Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial\n\nThe Privacy by Design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. PbD does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred − it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, Privacy by Design comes before-the-fact, not after.\n\n### Privacy as the Default\n\nWe can all be certain of one thing − the default rules! Privacy by Design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy − it is built into the system, by default.\n\n### Privacy Embedded into Design\n\nPrivacy by Design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system, without diminishing functionality\n\n### Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum\n\nPrivacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “winwin” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretence of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible, and far more desirable, to have both.\n\n### End-to-End Security – Lifecycle Protection\n\nPrivacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, Privacy by Design ensures cradle to grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.\n\n### Visibility and Transparency\n\nPrivacy by Design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to both users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify!\n\n### Respect for User Privacy\n\nAbove all, Privacy by Design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric!\n\n### Certification mechanism \n\nThe Personal Data Authority or a national accreditation body may accredit a certification body, to provide certificate showing that a controller or processor is operating in compliance with the AVG. This makes it clear to the user that his data is being handled securely. \n\n## Security by design \n\nSecurity should be a top priority for your developers as they implement your product's requirements at every stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC). We'll look at how to construct a secure SDLC in this article, so you can catch errors in requirements before they become security issues in production.\n\nSoftware Development Lifecycle (SDLC) describes how software applications are built. It usually contains the following phases: \n\n### Requirements \n\nThe requirements for new features are gathered from many stakeholders during this early stage. It's critical to identify any security concerns when gathering functional requirements for the new release.\n\n### Design\n\nThis phase turns in-scope requirements into a plan for how the application should be implemented. Functional requirements define what should happen, whereas security requirements indicate what should not happen.\n\n### Development \n\nWhen it comes to putting the idea into action and making it a reality, the focus frequently shifts to ensuring that the code is well-written from a security standpoint. Secure coding guidelines are usually created, as are code reviews to ensure that these guidelines have been followed appropriately. These code reviews can be done manually or automatically using tools like static application security testing (SAST).\n\n### Verification \n\nThe Verification step involves a thorough testing cycle to ensure that applications meet the original design and requirements. This is also an excellent opportunity to implement automated security testing, which can be done using a variety of technologies. Unless these tests pass, the application will not be deployed. To control verification and release, this phase frequently involves automated techniques like as CI/CD pipelines.\n\n### Maintenance and evolution \n\nThe story doesn't finish when the app is launched. In reality, security flaws that slipped through the holes in the application may be discovered decades after it has been deployed. These flaws can be detected in the code that developers authored, but they're also becoming more common in the underlying open-source components that make up an application. As a result, the number of \"zero-days\" vulnerabilities that were previously undiscovered but were discovered in production by the application's maintainers increases.\n\n## Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)\n\nIn its simplest form, the SDL is a process that standardizes security best practices across a range of products and/or applications. It captures industry-standard security activities, packaging them so they may be easily implemented. The software development lifecycle consists of several phases, which I will explain in more detail below.\n\n### The problems the SDL solves\n\nThe lack of a standard approach to securing products causes problems. For one thing, vulnerabilities run rampant in shipped products. The triage and response needed to deal with this are major resource sinks. As a result, developers spend too much time fixing code they wrote in the past and not enough focusing on the future.\n\nThe second problem is that developers tend to repeat the same security mistakes, each time expecting a different response (which is the definition of insanity). The third issue is that problems are found at release or after deployment, beyond the reasonable time when the problems could be mitigated in an inexpensive manner.\n\nFinally, without a security standard customers have no assurance that a given product is secure. A single product considered for purchase may be one of the good ones, or it might be terrible from a security perspective. Without an SDL, there is no product security parity across the company. And without a standard process, some product teams ignore security altogether.\n\n**Benefits of SDL**\n\nThe most important reasons to adopt SDL practices are:\n\n1. Higher security: In SDL, continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities results in better application quality and mitigation of business risks.\n2. Cost reduction: In SDL, early attention to flaws significantly reduces the effort required to detect and fix them.\n3. Regulatory compliance: SDL encourages a conscientious attitude toward security-related laws and regulations. Ignoring them may result in fines and penalties, even if no sensitive data is lost.\n4. Development teams get continuous training in secure coding practices.\n5. Security approaches become more consistent across teams.\n6. Customers trust the team more, because they see that special attention is paid to their security.\n7. Internal security improves when SDL is applied to in-house software tools.\n\n## In practice\n\nCommonly, secure programming improvement lifecycle measures are separated into the accompanying stages:\n\n###\tConcept and planning\n\nThis stage is used to define the application concept and analyze its suitability.

I would like to learn all this so I can apply it in my own projects. This will also come in handy for my follow-up study \"Data Science\" that I want to follow at the TUe. In the statistics course I will make a link with the Cyber subject by doing an analysis on Cyber related data. \nThis means I'm going to look for correlations between certain labels that have to do with, for example, malware. To show that I can apply the knowledge I have learned, I will analyze a dataset and present the data clearly and above all to people who are interested in it.\nIn order to apply statistics, a thorough knowledge of the mathematical formulas behind the analysis of these data is required. I learn this mathematics by following the course on \"Khan acandemy\". \nBy attending the lessons given by Peter Lambooij, a teacher at Fontys, I will make my knowledge measurable. During the lessons, we work on a project; we have to apply the knowledge we have learned. \nI am going to demonstrate this learning goal by showing the results and outcomes that have been released by Peter Lambooij. The results of the knowledge gained from the subject of statistics can be seen in the research. This research was conducted as a project within the subject of statistics. \n\n## Evaluate\n### Version (1)\nBelow are the results of that were obtained in the unit tests of the subject of statistics: \n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/first_results.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/first_results.png\" alt=\"First test results\"/>\n</a>\nAbove is the current status of the unit tests created for the subject of statistics. The unit tests were taken on the Khanacademy platform.  As seen above, all unit tests were passed with a minimum score of 70% or higher.  Since the workload is very high, it was difficult to keep up with all the material that was given each week. Also, the material itself was very difficult and sometimes hard to understand. During these first weeks I learned what the subject of statistics is and when and what it is used for. I also learned what static research is and the formulas that go with it by making hypotheses. \n\n[Khan academy - statistics-probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n### Version (2)\n\nIn my previous evaluation I showed my results from the beginning to the middle of the course. In this evaluation I have now finished the course and both my project and my khan unit have been evaluated. The given results are shown below:\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/second_results.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/second_results.png\" alt=\"second test results\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/research_project.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"some text\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"/images/projects/minor/statistics/research_project.png\" alt=\"research project result\"/>\n</a>\n\nI am very happy that I was able to attend this course.

You added up the numbers, divided by the number of items you can and *voila*! you get the average. For example, the average of 10, 5 and 20 is:\n\n10 + 6 + 20 = 36 / 3 = 12.\n\nThe you started studying statistics and all of a sudden the “average” is now called the mean. *What happened?* The answer is that they have the same meaning(they are synonyms).\n\n#### Mode \n\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. Other popular measures of central tendency include the mean, or the average of a set, and the [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp), the middle value in a set.\n\n#### Median\n\nThe median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. \n\nMedian is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median can be used to determine an approximate average, or [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp), but is not to be confused with the actual mean.\n\nThe absolute middle of an ordered ascending set of numbers. \n\n### Interquartile range (IQR)\n\nWhen a data set has outliers or extreme values, we summarize a typical value using the ***median\\*** as opposed to the mean. When a data set has outliers, variability is often summarized by a statistic called the ***interquartile range\\***, which is the difference between the first and third quartiles. The first quartile, denoted Q1, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *below* it. The third quartile, denoted Q3, is the value in the data set that holds 25% of the values *above* it. The quartiles can be determined following the same approach that we used to determine the median, but we now consider each half of the data set separately. \n\nIt kind of is like the mean of every 50% of the set.\n\n#### Example \n\n##### Normal\n\nSet: 62, 63, | 64 |, 64, 70, || 72, 76, | 77 |, 81,81\n\nMedian = (70 + 72) / 2 = 71\n\nMean = 71\n\nQ1 = 64\n\nQ3 = 77\n\n\n\n##### Odd number\n\nSet:  63, | 64 , 64 |, 70, | 72 |, 76, | 77, 81 | ,81\n\nMedian = 72\n\nMean = 72\n\nQ1 = (64 + 64) / 2 = 64\n\nQ3 = (77 + 81) / 2 = 79\n\n### Variance and standard deviation of a population\n\nInterestingly, in the real world no statistician would ever calculate standard deviation by hand. The calculations involved are somewhat complex, and the risk of making a mistake is high. Also, calculating by hand is slow. Very slow. This is why statisticians rely on spreadsheets and computer programs to crunch their numbers.\n\n#### Population\n\nThe formula for standard deviation (SD) is:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} /= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\mu \\rvert^2}}}{N}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nwhere ∑ sum means \"sum of\", x is a value in the data set, μ is the mean of the data set, and *N* is the number of data points in the population.\n\nThe standard deviation formula may look confusing, but it will make sense after we break it down. In the coming sections, we'll walk through a step-by-step interactive example. Here's a quick preview of the steps we're about to follow:\n\n#### Sample\n\nThe formula above is for finding the standard deviation of a population. If you're dealing with a sample, you'll want to use a slightly different formula (below), which uses n-1,  instead of *N*. \n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\bar{x} \\rvert^2}}}{n -1}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n### Mean absolute deviation (MAD)\n\nThe mean absolute deviation of a dataset is the average distance between each data point and the mean. It gives us an idea about the variability in a dataset.\n\nHere's how to calculate the mean absolute deviation.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the mean.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate how far away each data point is from the mean using positive distances. These are called absolute deviations.\n\n**Step 3:** Add those deviations together.\n\n**Step 4:** Divide the sum by the number of data points.\n\nFollowing these steps in the example below is probably the best way to learn about mean absolute deviation, but here is a more formal way to write the steps in a formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{MAD} = \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x_{i}- \\bar{x} \\rvert}}}{n}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n## Modeling data distributions\n\n### Distribution\n\n#### Normal\n\nThe normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in other types of statistical analyses. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). For a normal distribution, 68% of the observations are within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/- two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +- three standard deviations.\n\n##### Empirical rule \n\nIn statistics, the empirical rule states that 99.7% of data occurs within three standard deviations of the mean within a normal distribution. To this end, 68% of the observed data will occur within the first standard deviation, 95% will take place in the second deviation, and 97.5% within the third standard deviation. The empirical rule predicts the probability distribution for a set of outcomes. \n\nThe empirical rule is applied to anticipate probable outcomes in a normal distribution. For instance, a statistician would use this to estimate the percentage of cases that fall in each standard deviation. Consider that the standard deviation is 3.1 and the mean equals 10. In this case, the first standard deviation would range between (10+3.2)= 13.2 and (10-3.2)= 6.8. The second deviation would fall between 10 + (2 X 3.2)= 16.4 and 10 - (2 X 3.2)= 3.6, and so forth. \n\n#### Skewness\n\n##### Left\n\nA **[left-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewLeft)** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called *negatively-skewed* distributions. That’s because there is a [long tail](https://www.statisticshowto.com/long-tail-distribution/) in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the [peak](https://www.statisticshowto.com/peak-of-a-distribution/).\n\nIn most cases, the [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is to the left of the median. This isn’t a reliable test for skewness though, as some distributions (i.e. many [multimodal distributions](https://www.statisticshowto.com/multimodal-distribution/)) violate this rule. You should think of this as a “general idea” kind of rule, and not a set-in-stone one.\n\n##### Right\n\nA **[right-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewRight)** has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the positive direction on the number line. The [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is also to the right of the peak.\n\nOn a right-skewed histogram, the mean, median, and mode are all different. In this case, the mode is the highest point of the histogram, whereas the median and mean fall to the right of it (or, visually, the right of the peak). Note that [the mean will *always* be to the right of the median](http://www.statisticshowto.com/skewed-distribution/).\n\n### Percentile Formula\n\n**Percentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100**\n\nP = (n/N) × 100\n\nWhere, \n\n- n = ordinal rank of the given value or value below the number\n- N = number of values in the data set \n- P = percentile \n\nOr \n\nPercentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100\n\n### Z-scores\n\n**Simply put, a z-score (also called a \\*standard score\\*) gives you an idea of how far from the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/) a data point is.** But more technically it’s a measure of how many [standard deviations](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/) below or above the [population mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/population-mean/)a [raw score](https://www.statisticshowto.com/raw-score/) is.\n\nA z-score can be placed on a [**normal distribution**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/) curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean) μ and also the population standard deviation σ.\n\n#### Bases \n\nSimply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives an idea of how far away it is from the mean value of a data point. More technically, it is a measure of the number of standard deviations below or above the given population that signify a raw score.\n\nDe basis z-scoreformule voor een steekproef is:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\nwhere:\n\n- **x:** individual data value\n- **μ:** population mean\n- **σ:** population standard deviation\n\nA z-score for an individual value can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **Positive z-score:** The individual value is greater than the mean.\n- **Negative z-score:** The individual value is less than the mean.\n- **A z-score of 0:** The individual value is equal to the mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nFor example, let's say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\n= 190 – 150 / 25 = 1.6.\n\nThe z-score tells you as many standard deviations from the mean of your score. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.\n\n#### Standard error of the mean\n\nIf you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those samples (the standard deviation), you would use this z-score formula:\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nThis z-score tells you that there are many standard errors between the sample mean and the population mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nIn general, the average height of women is 65″ with a standard deviation of 3.5″. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70″, assuming the heights are normally distributed?\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\n= (70 – 65) / (3.5/√50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1\n\n## Probability\n\nRandomness is all around us. Probability theory is the mathematical framework that allows us to analyze chance events in a logically sound manner. The probability of an event is a number indicating how likely that event will occur. This number is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.\n\nA classic example of a probabilistic experiment is a fair coin toss, in which the two possible outcomes are heads or tails. In this case, the probability of flipping a head or a tail is 1/2. In an actual series of coin tosses, we may get more or less than exactly 50% heads. But as the number of flips increases, the long-run frequency of heads is bound to get closer and closer to 50%.\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;P(E)=\\sum _{x\\in E}f(x)\\,.\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n```P(A) = (# of ways A can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)```\n\n- The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1 and can also be written as a percentage or fraction.\n- The probability of event *A* is often written as ```P(A)```.\n- If ```P(A) > P(B)```,  then event *A* has a higher chance of occurring than event *B*.\n- If ```P(A) = P(B)```, then events *A* and *B* are equally likely to occur.\n\n## Combinations and Permutations\n\nThe difference between combinations and permutations is ordering. **With permutations we care about the order of the elements, whereas with combinations we don’t.**\n\nFor example, say your locker “combo” is 5432. If you enter 4325 into your locker it won’t open because it is a different ordering (aka permutation).\n\nThe **permutations** of 2, 3, 4, 5 are:\n\n- **5432,** 5423, 5324, 5342, 5234, 5243, 4532, 4523, 4325, 4352, 4253, 4235, 3542, 3524, 3425, 3452, 3254, 3245, 2543, 2534, 2435, 2453, 2354, 2345\n\n  24 combinations\n\nYour locker “combo” is a specific permutation of 2, 3, 4 and 5. If your locker worked truly by combination, you could enter any of the above permutations and it would open!\n\nSuppose you want to know how many permutations exist of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 without listing them like I did above. How would you accomplish this?\n\nUsing the *Multiplication Principle of combinatorics,* we know that if there are *x* ways of doing one thing and *y* ways of doing another, then the total number of ways of doing both things is *x•y*. That means we need to multiply to find the total permutations.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to use shorthand **factorial notation (!)**:\n\n4! = 4*•*3*•*2*•*1 = 24\n\nThere are 24 permutations, which matches the listing we made at the beginning of this post.\n\n### Permutations with Repetition\n\nWhat if I wanted to find the total number of permutations involving the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 but want to include orderings such as 5555 or 2234 where not all of the numbers are used, and some are used more than once?\nHow many of these permutations exist?\nThis turns out to be a simple calculation. Again we are composing a 4-digit number, so draw 4 lines to represent the digits.\n\n4•4•4•4 = 4^4 = 256\n\n### Combinations Formula\n\nIf we have *n* objects and we want to choose *k* of them*,* we can find the total number of combinations by using the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nFor example, we have 52 cards (n=52) and want to know how many 5-card hands (k=5) we can make.\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{52}{5}) = \\dfrac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n### Permutations Formula\n\nThe formula for permutations is similar to the combinations formula, except we needn’t divide out the permutations, so we can remove k! from the denominator:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\nsources: \n\n[datascience.eu](https://datascience.eu/nl/wiskunde-statistiek/wat-is-een-z-score/)\n\n[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp)\n\n[statology](https://www.statology.org/comparing-z-scores/)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp)\n\n[sphweb.bumc.bu.edu](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_summarizingdata/bs704_summarizingdata7.html)\n\n[medium](https://medium.com/i-math/combinations-permutations-fa7ac680f0ac)\n\n[seeing-theory.brown.edu](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)\n","dir":"/projects/other","path":"/projects/other/statistic-formulas","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","bodyPlainText":"small\nI am a visual learner so I find it hard to understand material by just reading it I have to make myself visual illustrations this has done both the khan cource for me and the many notes I have made. \n\n# Statistical formulas\n\n## Summarizing quantitative data\n\n### quantitative data\n\n#### Mean\n\nWhen you first started out in mathematics, you were probably taught that an average was a “middling” amount for a set of numbers.

The quartiles can be determined following the same approach that we used to determine the median, but we now consider each half of the data set separately. \n\nIt kind of is like the mean of every 50% of the set.\n\n#### Example \n\n##### Normal\n\nSet: 62, 63, | 64 |, 64, 70, || 72, 76, | 77 |, 81,81\n\nMedian = (70 + 72) / 2 = 71\n\nMean = 71\n\nQ1 = 64\n\nQ3 = 77\n\n\n\n##### Odd number\n\nSet:  63, | 64 , 64 |, 70, | 72 |, 76, | 77, 81 | ,81\n\nMedian = 72\n\nMean = 72\n\nQ1 = (64 + 64) / 2 = 64\n\nQ3 = (77 + 81) / 2 = 79\n\n### Variance and standard deviation of a population\n\nInterestingly, in the real world no statistician would ever calculate standard deviation by hand. The calculations involved are somewhat complex, and the risk of making a mistake is high. Also, calculating by hand is slow. Very slow. This is why statisticians rely on spreadsheets and computer programs to crunch their numbers.\n\n#### Population\n\nThe formula for standard deviation (SD) is:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} /= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\mu \\rvert^2}}}{N}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nwhere ∑ sum means \"sum of\", x is a value in the data set, μ is the mean of the data set, and *N* is the number of data points in the population.\n\nThe standard deviation formula may look confusing, but it will make sense after we break it down. In the coming sections, we'll walk through a step-by-step interactive example. Here's a quick preview of the steps we're about to follow:\n\n#### Sample\n\nThe formula above is for finding the standard deviation of a population. If you're dealing with a sample, you'll want to use a slightly different formula (below), which uses n-1,  instead of *N*. \n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{SD} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x- \\bar{x} \\rvert^2}}}{n -1}}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n### Mean absolute deviation (MAD)\n\nThe mean absolute deviation of a dataset is the average distance between each data point and the mean. It gives us an idea about the variability in a dataset.\n\nHere's how to calculate the mean absolute deviation.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the mean.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate how far away each data point is from the mean using positive distances. These are called absolute deviations.\n\n**Step 3:** Add those deviations together.\n\n**Step 4:** Divide the sum by the number of data points.\n\nFollowing these steps in the example below is probably the best way to learn about mean absolute deviation, but here is a more formal way to write the steps in a formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;\\text{MAD} = \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{}^{}{{\\lvert x_{i}- \\bar{x} \\rvert}}}{n}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n## Modeling data distributions\n\n### Distribution\n\n#### Normal\n\nThe normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in other types of statistical analyses. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp). For a normal distribution, 68% of the observations are within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/- two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +- three standard deviations.\n\n##### Empirical rule \n\nIn statistics, the empirical rule states that 99.7% of data occurs within three standard deviations of the mean within a normal distribution. To this end, 68% of the observed data will occur within the first standard deviation, 95% will take place in the second deviation, and 97.5% within the third standard deviation. The empirical rule predicts the probability distribution for a set of outcomes. \n\nThe empirical rule is applied to anticipate probable outcomes in a normal distribution. For instance, a statistician would use this to estimate the percentage of cases that fall in each standard deviation. Consider that the standard deviation is 3.1 and the mean equals 10. In this case, the first standard deviation would range between (10+3.2)= 13.2 and (10-3.2)= 6.8. The second deviation would fall between 10 + (2 X 3.2)= 16.4 and 10 - (2 X 3.2)= 3.6, and so forth. \n\n#### Skewness\n\n##### Left\n\nA **[left-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewLeft)** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called *negatively-skewed* distributions. That’s because there is a [long tail](https://www.statisticshowto.com/long-tail-distribution/) in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the [peak](https://www.statisticshowto.com/peak-of-a-distribution/).\n\nIn most cases, the [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is to the left of the median. This isn’t a reliable test for skewness though, as some distributions (i.e. many [multimodal distributions](https://www.statisticshowto.com/multimodal-distribution/)) violate this rule. You should think of this as a “general idea” kind of rule, and not a set-in-stone one.\n\n##### Right\n\nA **[right-skewed distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/skewed-distribution/#SkewRight)** has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the positive direction on the number line. The [mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean)is also to the right of the peak.\n\nOn a right-skewed histogram, the mean, median, and mode are all different. In this case, the mode is the highest point of the histogram, whereas the median and mean fall to the right of it (or, visually, the right of the peak). Note that [the mean will *always* be to the right of the median](http://www.statisticshowto.com/skewed-distribution/).\n\n### Percentile Formula\n\n**Percentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100**\n\nP = (n/N) × 100\n\nWhere, \n\n- n = ordinal rank of the given value or value below the number\n- N = number of values in the data set \n- P = percentile \n\nOr \n\nPercentile = (Number of Values Below “x” / Total Number of Values) × 100\n\n### Z-scores\n\n**Simply put, a z-score (also called a \\*standard score\\*) gives you an idea of how far from the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/) a data point is.** But more technically it’s a measure of how many [standard deviations](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/) below or above the [population mean ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/population-mean/)a [raw score](https://www.statisticshowto.com/raw-score/) is.\n\nA z-score can be placed on a [**normal distribution**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/) curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the [mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean) μ and also the population standard deviation σ.\n\n#### Bases \n\nSimply put, a z-score (also called a standard score) gives an idea of how far away it is from the mean value of a data point. More technically, it is a measure of the number of standard deviations below or above the given population that signify a raw score.\n\nDe basis z-scoreformule voor een steekproef is:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\nwhere:\n\n- **x:** individual data value\n- **μ:** population mean\n- **σ:** population standard deviation\n\nA z-score for an individual value can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **Positive z-score:** The individual value is greater than the mean.\n- **Negative z-score:** The individual value is less than the mean.\n- **A z-score of 0:** The individual value is equal to the mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nFor example, let's say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:\n\nz = (x – μ) / σ\n\n= 190 – 150 / 25 = 1.6.\n\nThe z-score tells you as many standard deviations from the mean of your score. In this example, your score is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.\n\n#### Standard error of the mean\n\nIf you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those samples (the standard deviation), you would use this z-score formula:\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nThis z-score tells you that there are many standard errors between the sample mean and the population mean.\n\n##### Example\n\nIn general, the average height of women is 65″ with a standard deviation of 3.5″. What is the probability of finding a random sample of 50 women with a mean height of 70″, assuming the heights are normally distributed?\n\nz = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)\n\n= (70 – 65) / (3.5/√50) = 5 / 0.495 = 10.1\n\n## Probability\n\nRandomness is all around us. Probability theory is the mathematical framework that allows us to analyze chance events in a logically sound manner. The probability of an event is a number indicating how likely that event will occur. This number is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.\n\nA classic example of a probabilistic experiment is a fair coin toss, in which the two possible outcomes are heads or tails. In this case, the probability of flipping a head or a tail is 1/2. In an actual series of coin tosses, we may get more or less than exactly 50% heads. But as the number of flips increases, the long-run frequency of heads is bound to get closer and closer to 50%.\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;P(E)=\\sum _{x\\in E}f(x)\\,.\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\n```P(A) = (# of ways A can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)```\n\n- The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1 and can also be written as a percentage or fraction.\n- The probability of event *A* is often written as ```P(A)```.\n- If ```P(A) > P(B)```,  then event *A* has a higher chance of occurring than event *B*.\n- If ```P(A) = P(B)```, then events *A* and *B* are equally likely to occur.\n\n## Combinations and Permutations\n\nThe difference between combinations and permutations is ordering. **With permutations we care about the order of the elements, whereas with combinations we don’t.**\n\nFor example, say your locker “combo” is 5432. If you enter 4325 into your locker it won’t open because it is a different ordering (aka permutation).\n\nThe **permutations** of 2, 3, 4, 5 are:\n\n- **5432,** 5423, 5324, 5342, 5234, 5243, 4532, 4523, 4325, 4352, 4253, 4235, 3542, 3524, 3425, 3452, 3254, 3245, 2543, 2534, 2435, 2453, 2354, 2345\n\n  24 combinations\n\nYour locker “combo” is a specific permutation of 2, 3, 4 and 5. If your locker worked truly by combination, you could enter any of the above permutations and it would open!\n\nSuppose you want to know how many permutations exist of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 without listing them like I did above. How would you accomplish this?\n\nUsing the *Multiplication Principle of combinatorics,* we know that if there are *x* ways of doing one thing and *y* ways of doing another, then the total number of ways of doing both things is *x•y*. That means we need to multiply to find the total permutations.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to use shorthand **factorial notation (!)**:\n\n4! = 4*•*3*•*2*•*1 = 24\n\nThere are 24 permutations, which matches the listing we made at the beginning of this post.\n\n### Permutations with Repetition\n\nWhat if I wanted to find the total number of permutations involving the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 but want to include orderings such as 5555 or 2234 where not all of the numbers are used, and some are used more than once?\nHow many of these permutations exist?\nThis turns out to be a simple calculation. Again we are composing a 4-digit number, so draw 4 lines to represent the digits.\n\n4•4•4•4 = 4^4 = 256\n\n### Combinations Formula\n\nIf we have *n* objects and we want to choose *k* of them*,* we can find the total number of combinations by using the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\nFor example, we have 52 cards (n=52) and want to know how many 5-card hands (k=5) we can make.\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{52}{5}) = \\dfrac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n### Permutations Formula\n\nThe formula for permutations is similar to the combinations formula, except we needn’t divide out the permutations, so we can remove k! from the denominator:\n\n<img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\color{Magenta}\\Large&space;(\\dfrac{n}{k}) = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}\" title=\"formula\" />\n\n\n\nsources: \n\n[datascience.eu](https://datascience.eu/nl/wiskunde-statistiek/wat-is-een-z-score/)\n\n[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp)\n\n[statology](https://www.statology.org/comparing-z-scores/)\n\n[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empirical-rule.asp)\n\n[sphweb.bumc.bu.edu](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_summarizingdata/bs704_summarizingdata7.html)\n\n[medium](https://medium.com/i-math/combinations-permutations-fa7ac680f0ac)\n\n[seeing-theory.brown.edu](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)\n","readingTime":"12 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1638882819087},"$loki":13},{"slug":"other_time-management","description":"How to manage time and make priorities","id":null,"title":"Time Management -            plangroup. student+","duration":"1 whole day in total","image":"/images/projects/minor/time-management.png","tech":[{"name":"time management"}],"category":[{"name":"body of knowledge"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"toc":[{"id":"eisenhower-model","depth":2,"text":"Eisenhower model"},{"id":"urgent-as-well-as-important-do-it","depth":3,"text":"Urgent as well as important.

Not urgent not important: forget; comes later!\n\n## How to use \n\n- Putting things to-do on a list frees your mind. But always question what is worth doing first.\n- Try limiting yourself to no more than eight tasks per quadrant. Before adding another one, complete the most important one first. Remember: It is not about collecting but finishing tasks.\n- You should always maintain only one list for both business and private tasks. That way you will never be able to complain about not having done anything for your family or yourself at the end of the day.\n- Do not let you or others distract you. Do not let others define your priority. Plan in the morning, then work on your stuff. And in the end, enjoy the feeling of completion.\n- Finally, try not to procrastinate that much. Not even by over-managing your to-dos.\n","readingTime":"3 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1638882819098},"$loki":14},{"slug":"other_vim","description":"What is vim and why should you use it as a professional","id":null,"title":"Vim","duration":"1 whole day in total","image":"/images/projects/other/time-management.jpg","tech":[{"name":"vim"},{"name":"ide"}],"category":[{"name":"body of knowledge"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"toc":[{"id":"extensibility","depth":2,"text":"Extensibility"},{"id":"community","depth":2,"text":"Community"},{"id":"composability","depth":2,"text":"Composability"},{"id":"intelligent-code-completion","depth":2,"text":"Intelligent code completion"},{"id":"what-is-neovim","depth":2,"text":"What is Neovim?"},{"id":"how-i-started","depth":2,"text":"How I started:"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"vim-ide"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#vim-ide","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Vim (IDE)"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There's a reason why, after decades, countless developers still prefer Vim as their code editor of choice.

Vim (IDE)\n\nThere's a reason why, after decades, countless developers still prefer Vim as their code editor of choice. That many people can't be wrong, right? Vim is a  free open source software. My first experience with Vim was when I accidentally entered it and could not get out. I had to google [how to exit vim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor) to escape. I asked, *\"why would anyone ever use this awful editor?\"* Fast forward 4 years, this awful editor is now my primary editor. I've tried editors like *Notepad++, Atom, Intellij and VSCode*\n\nThis semester enabled me to make the switch to this environment. This did not work out last semester because there is a very intensive learning curve to learning vim. \n\nI think a great editor needs to have these three features:\n\n- Extensibility\n- Community\n- Composability\n- Intelligent code completion\n\nVim is what I use because it has all four of the capabilities listed above. Allow me to explain each one.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nIf you've used VSCode, Atom, or Sublime, then you know being able to add and remove plugins easily is an indispensable feature. This functionality is also provided by vim but that's not all because vim allows you to choose your own plugin manager according to your needs. In my environment I use packer. \n\n## Community\n\nIn open source technology, the community is very crucial. As long as there are enough contributing developers, a vibrant community assures continual development and problem fixes. More community plugins, tutorials, and human help are all part of the equation. The Vim community is quite active. It has a reddit page, a stackexchange account, and a number of specialized twitter accounts, among other things. I personally learned a lot from the vim master ThePrimeagen on youtube and twitch.\n\n## Composability\n\nIn addition to extensibility and community, Vim features composability, which I believe is a trait that many non-modal editors lack.\n\nCompo..what?\n\nComposability refers to the ability to combine a set of generic instructions to achieve more complicated tasks. In the same way that you can make complicated abstractions out of smaller abstractions in programming, you can run complex commands out of simpler ones in Vim. Vim contains movement motions and editing operators (there are also text objects, but I won't go over them here).\n\n## Intelligent code completion\n\nIntelligent code completion is a context-aware code completion function in various programming environments that reduces typos and other typical errors to speed up the writing process. Attempts at this are often made by using auto-completion popups while typing, querying function arguments, and query tips for syntax mistakes. Reflection is used to provide documentation and disambiguation for variable names, functions, and methods utilizing intelligent code completion and associated technologies. also for this complexity, vim has several plugins that can support you with this. \n\n# Learning curve\n\nit's not a curve it's a wall, but if you break it you'll earn your geekhood!\n\nIf you use vim all day and make an effort to use it well, you’ll be editing code faster than you did in your old editor within two weeks. Learning vim is like this. At first, you do everything as simply as possible. Then you start to wonder if there are faster ways to get things done, and there are! If you chain those commands together they just work! You bump into things accidentally, or maybe you spend some time in the extensive help files.\n\nThe hardest thing is all the key combinations possible within vim. \n\nThis can be very overwhelming but it is not at all necessary to learn all the key combinations at once with as many as 10 combinations you can use all of vim already!\n\nOnce you are in the eqos system of vim there is no going back just like apple. \n\n## What is Neovim?\n\nButtt..... let's bring neovim in to the picture \n\nNeovim is a community-driven open source project and a fork of the Vim text editor designed to make Vim's core developers' lives simpler. It's an upgraded Vim text editor out of the box, or to put it another way, it's a more streamlined Vim that makes integrations lot easier than Vim. Vim is already the most popular text editor and the text editor of choice for programmers. Consider Neovim to be the Vim editor of the future, aiming to remedy some of the shortcomings of its predecessor. For one thing, building plug-ins proved difficult, and Vim isn't well-suited to current systems. So, Neovim fixes the issues you were having with Vim. Neovim improves on Vim by providing a totally redesigned plug-in architecture, a better GUI ecosystem, first-class embedding support, and more.\n\nDuring my introduction to neovim I found out that neovim and the community were in transition this made the learning process super convenient. This transition took place through the introduction of lua files. A lua file contains [source code](https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode) written in Lua, a light-weight programming language designed for extending or adding functionality to software applications. The Lua scripting language [syntax](https://techterms.com/definition/syntax) is simple but supports a large number of [data types](https://techterms.com/definition/datatype) and operators. Lua is very weel integrated with Neovim, and with LuaJIT, it is much faster than vimscript. If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language with a passion because like I told before its really difficult to integrate. \n\nLet's talk about lua files.\n\nLet's take the following folder structure as an example:\n\n``` \n📂 ~/.config/nvim\n├── 📁 plugins\n├── 📂 lua\n│  └── 📂 setup_plugins\n|  ├── 🌑 plugin_manager.lua\n|  ├── 🌑 mappings.lua\n│  └── 🌑 settings.lua\n└── 🇻 init.lua (or) init.vim\n```\n\nnvim has no fixed folder structure but I personally find this the most logical structure for my needs. My init file is my main file as with many languages it is the starting point. From here I put references to different sub folders that all have their own domain.\n\nIn my settings I set all preferences like font type colors but also tab spacing. My plugin manager is the place where I indicate which plugins I would like to use within my environment. my mapping allows me to create different keybindings.  \n\nThere are still an awful lot of things you can make especially with the integration with lua files, but I'm not working on this at the moment. \n\nBelow is a link pointing to my .dotfiles containing my configuration of nvim. \n\n[.config/nvim](https://github.com/rikp777/.dotfiles/tree/master/nvim/.config/nvim)\n\n## How I started:\n\nMy learning process began with configuring a my own vim script.

The answer is actually quite simple: you have to prove that you are a human being!\n\nScripts, which we also call bots or robots, are constantly scouring the Internet. Some of them provide information about a website to a search engine. But there are also bots that look for forms and fill them automatically with all kinds of garbage.\n\nTo prevent this robot/bot from simply clicking the submit button, a captcha is placed in the middle. This must first be completed correctly before the form can be submitted.\n\nSome examples of when to use a Captcha:\n\n- **Maintaining poll accuracy**\n- **Limiting registration for services**\n- **Preventing ticket inflation**\n- **Preventing false comments**\n\nCAPTCHA stands for: \n\n\"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\"\n\n## Types\n\nThere are several captchas that can be implemented now a day such as:\n\n### reCAPTCHA v3\n\nreCAPTCHA v3 allows you to verify if an interaction is legitimate without any user interaction. It is a pure JavaScript API returning a score, giving you the ability to take action in the context of your site: for instance requiring additional factors of authentication, sending a post to moderation, or throttling bots that may be scraping content.\n\n### reCAPTCHA (v2)\n\n#### Visible \n\nThe \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox requires the user to click a checkbox indicating the user is not a robot. This will either pass the user immediately (with No CAPTCHA) or challenge them to validate whether or not they are human. This is the simplest option to integrate with and only requires two lines of HTML to render the checkbox.\n\n#### Invisible \n\nThe invisible reCAPTCHA badge does not require the user to click on a checkbox, instead it is invoked directly when the user clicks on an existing button on your site or can be invoked via a JavaScript API call. The integration requires a JavaScript callback when reCAPTCHA verification is complete. By default only the most suspicious traffic will be prompted to solve a captcha. To alter this behavior edit your site security preference under advanced settings.\n\n### Visual captchas (v1)\n\nIn many cases the captchas are based on text, number combinations and characters that are difficult to recognize. A capcha is build a way that one user will never get the same captcha twice. There are also captchas that ask the user questions there are multiple types of question but most of them are based on image recognition. For example click all taxi's in the box below. Some characteristics are:\n\n- Letters and numbers are usually not nicely juxtaposed, but scattered across the screen.\n- The characters are not nicely straight, but rotated.\n- Different fonts (typefaces) are used.\n- A background image or different colors are used; almost never 1 color.\n\nv1 is not supported anymore since 2018 despite that many site still have this implementation. This implementation of captchas also ranked as most irritating among people. That's why there are new versions today that thoroughly address this problem.\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe first step is the simplest. Go to the [reCAPTCHA homepage ](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)and click on the *Get reCAPTCHA* button at the top of the screen. On the next screen, you’ll find a prompt to enter a label and domain for your site, so you can identify it among your reCAPTCHA properties.\n\nPopulate both fields, click on *Register*, and you’re done. On the next screen, you’ll receive both a *Site Key* and a *Secret Key*.\n\n\n\n#### Front-end\n\nTo use reCaptcha I followed the documentation steps, but with the help of a package from yarn to vue, **vue-recaptcha**, which provides me with a basically ready component, just implement it and capture the event from validation you can see more about it\n\n##### Instalation\n\nyarn add vue-recaptcha-v3\nyarn add axios\n\nIn my **app.js** where I store my environment variables I will set the site key and url of my api, which in this case will be running on localhost\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { VueReCaptcha } from 'vue-recaptcha-v3'\n\nVue.use(VueReCaptcha, { siteKey: '<site key>' })\n\nnew Vue({\n  methods: {\n    async recaptcha() {\n      // (optional) Wait until recaptcha has been loaded.\n      await this.$recaptchaLoaded()\n\n      // Execute reCAPTCHA with action \"login\".\n      const token = await this.$recaptcha('login')\n\n      // Do stuff with the received token.\n      console.log(token) // Will print the token\n    }\n  },\n  template: '<button @click=\"recaptcha\">Execute recaptcha</button>'\n})\n```\n\nEach reCAPTCHA user response token is valid for two minutes, and can only be verified *once* to prevent replay attacks. If you need a new token, you can re-run the reCAPTCHA verification.\n\nAfter you get the response token, you need to verify it within two minutes with reCAPTCHA using the following API to ensure the token is valid.\n\n##### API Request\n\nURL: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify \t\t\t\tMETHOD: POST\n\n| OST Parameter | Description                                                  |\n| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| secret        | Required.

Almost all big programming languages such as Java, C# have them embedded in their language. \n\nBut before we go deeper in to the topic you first need to understand what a regular expression ( regex) is. Regex  is a character set witch describes certain patterns its is mostly used to match and locate text in a string. \n\nA regular expressions is a way to describe patterns. A computer can recognize these regular expressions and will be able to recognize text inside for example a document. You can for example use a regular expression to search through a text or check if an email-address is correctly formatted.\n\nThere are a lot of character used in a regular expression and it can be unreadable to the untrained eye.\n\n## Cheat sheet summary \n\nTo make a regex yourself you need to understand the list below. in doing so you have to understand what each character means and does. \n\n| Character   | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| \\           | the escape character - used to find an instance of a meta character like a period, brackets, etc. |\n| .           | match any character except newline |\n| x           | match any instance of x |\n| ^x          | match any character except x |\n| [x]         | match any instance of x in the bracketed range - [abxyz] will match any instance of a, b, x, y, or z|\n| \\|           | an OR operator - [xꟾy] will match an instance of x or y |\n| () | used to group sequences of characters or matches |\n| {} | used to define numeric quantifiers |\n| {x} | match must occur exactly x times |\n| {x,} | match must occur at least x times |\n| {x,y} | match must occur at least x times, but no more than y times |\n| ? | preceding match is optional or one only, same as {0,1} |\n| * | find 0 or more of preceding match, same as {0,} |\n| + | find 1 or more of preceding match, same as {1,} |\n| ^ | match the beginning of the line |\n| $ | match the end of a line |\n|  |  |\n| [:alpha:] | Represents an alphabetic character.

But you must be able to understand what is being performed in such an expression.\n\n# Cyber \n\n## Denial of service attack (ReDoS)\n\nA denial of service attack is when an attacker makes an online service slow down or become unavailable to its users. \n\nDenial-of-service for regular expressions (ReDoS) is a denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the fact that most implementations of regular expressions can get into extreme situations that make them work very slowly (exponentially depending on the input size). An attacker can use a [stripped down] regular expression to get a program into these extreme situations and then get stuck for a long time. \n\n### Evil Regex\n\nA regex pattern is known as a evil regex if it can get stuck in the generated input that is given.\n\nEvil regex contains :\n\n- Grouping with a lot of repetition\n- Inside of repetition group \n  - Again repetition (many nested repertitions)\n  - Alternation with overlapping\n\nsome examples \n\n- ```regex\n  ^(a+)+$\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  ([a-zA-Z]+)*\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|aa)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|a?)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (.*a){x} for x \\> 10\n  ```\n\n- ``` regex\n  \\^([a-zA-Z0-9])(([\\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+))*(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})|([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$ \n  ```\n\n\nThese regex expressions are all sensitive to the string input:\n- \t\t\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar url = 'https://google.com/'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (url.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(url + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(url + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/ is a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2ms\n```\n\nBut now consider to apply the regular expression on a bad url introduced in our code by an attacker.\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar badUrl = 'https://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (badUrl.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@ is not a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2196ms\n```\n\nAs you can observe, the evaluation time of regex has been increased by 1000 times by adding only 25 characters to previous url. Let's see why.\n\n__Fair warning, I actually managed to crash my computer when trying this out by giving a super long string as input._\n\n### The attack \n\n\n\n### Prevent This Vulnerability\n\nRecognizing evil regular expressions requires in-depth knowledge / experience with them. There are also tools to recognize these types of regular expressions. As a software-engineer you have to be vary careful when applying regular expressions in your code. Always have a limit on how many characters to accept from a input. Or use standard libraries to check certain expressions. \"Sanitize and filter user's inputs\" this is a rule valid also for other type of attacks. Since the attack can be originated from a input string, filter and sanitize it before to evaluate it to avoid unhandled errors or attacks.\n\n","dir":"/projects/software-engineering","path":"/projects/software-engineering/regular-expressions","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","updatedAt":"2021-12-07T13:12:15.957Z","bodyPlainText":"\n# Regular expressions\n\nRegular expressions are one of the most used programming functions. Almost all big programming languages such as Java, C# have them embedded in their language. \n\nBut before we go deeper in to the topic you first need to understand what a regular expression ( regex) is. Regex  is a character set witch describes certain patterns its is mostly used to match and locate text in a string. \n\nA regular expressions is a way to describe patterns. A computer can recognize these regular expressions and will be able to recognize text inside for example a document. You can for example use a regular expression to search through a text or check if an email-address is correctly formatted.\n\nThere are a lot of character used in a regular expression and it can be unreadable to the untrained eye.\n\n## Cheat sheet summary \n\nTo make a regex yourself you need to understand the list below. in doing so you have to understand what each character means and does. \n\n| Character   | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| \\           | the escape character - used to find an instance of a meta character like a period, brackets, etc. |\n| .           | match any character except newline |\n| x           | match any instance of x |\n| ^x          | match any character except x |\n| [x]         | match any instance of x in the bracketed range - [abxyz] will match any instance of a, b, x, y, or z|\n| \\|           | an OR operator - [xꟾy] will match an instance of x or y |\n| () | used to group sequences of characters or matches |\n| {} | used to define numeric quantifiers |\n| {x} | match must occur exactly x times |\n| {x,} | match must occur at least x times |\n| {x,y} | match must occur at least x times, but no more than y times |\n| ? | preceding match is optional or one only, same as {0,1} |\n| * | find 0 or more of preceding match, same as {0,} |\n| + | find 1 or more of preceding match, same as {1,} |\n| ^ | match the beginning of the line |\n| $ | match the end of a line |\n|  |  |\n| [:alpha:] | Represents an alphabetic character. Use [:alpha:]+ to find one of them. |\n| [:digit:] | Represents a decimal digit. Use [:digit:]+ to find one of them. |\n| [:alnum:] | Represents an alphanumeric character ([:alpha:] and [:digit:]). |\n| [:space:] | Represents a space character (but not other whitespace characters). |\n| [:print:] | Represents a printable character. |\n| [:cntrl:] | Represents a nonprinting character. |\n| [:lower:] | Represents a lowercase character if Match case is selected in Options. |\n| [:upper:] | Represents an uppercase character if Match case is selected in Options. |\n|  |  |\n| \\d | matches a digit, same as [0-9] |\n| \\D | matches a non-digit, same as [^0-9] |\n| \\s | matches a whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.) |\n| \\S | matches a non-whitespace character |\n| \\w | matches a word character |\n| \\W | matches a non-word character |\n| \\b | matches a word-boundary (NOTE: within a class, matches a backspace) |\n| \\B | matches a non-wordboundary |\n\nass you can see its quite an extensive list of characters\n\nRegex is a realy powerfull tool to restrict string inputs \n\n| Description                   | Regex                           ||\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| (1) Email address             | ^[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*@([a-z0-9-]+(\\.[a-z0-9-]+)*?\\.[a-z]{2,6}\\|(\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3})(:\\d{4})?$ |                                                              |\n| (2) Email address             | ^[\\\\w\\\\-]+(\\\\.[\\\\w\\\\-]+)*@([A-Za-z0-9-]+\\\\.)+[A-Za-z]{2,4}$ |                                                              |\n| (3) Email address -           | ^([\\w\\.*\\-*]+@([\\w]\\.*\\-*)+[a-zA-Z]{2,9}(\\s*;\\s*[\\w\\.*\\-*]+@([\\w]\\.*\\-*)+[a-zA-Z]{2,9})*)$ | List of semi-colon seperated email addresses                 |\n| (4) Email adress              | ^([a-zA-Z0-9._%-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})*$   |                                                              |\n| Credit Cards                  | ^(?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?\\|5[1-5][0-9]{14}\\|6011[0-9]{12}\\|622((12[6-9]\\|1[3-9][0-9])\\|([2-8][0-9][0-9])\\|(9(([0-1][0-9])\\|(2[0-5]))))[0-9]{10}\\|64[4-9][0-9]{13}\\|65[0-9]{14}\\|3(?:0[0-5]\\|[68][0-9])[0-9]{11}\\|3[47][0-9]{13})*$ |                                                              |\n| IP Address                    | ^((?:(?:25[0-5]\\|2[0-4][0-9]\\|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]\\|2[0-4][0-9]\\|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?))*$ |                                                              |\n| Username                      | [^@/]+@[^@/]+                                          | of type test@test                                            |\n| Multiple spaces replacement   | \\\\\\s+                                                  |                                                              |\n| Non-alphanumeric replacement  | [^a-zA-Z0-9]                                           |                                                              |\n| Blank line                    | ^$                                                     |                                                              |\n| Positive integers             | ^[1-9]+[0-9]*$                                         |                                                              |\n| Positive decimal values       | (^\\d*\\.?\\d*[0-9]+\\d*$)\\|(^[0-9]+\\d*\\.\\d*$)              |                                                              |\n| Percentage (2 decimal places) | ^-?[0-9]{0,2}(\\.[0-9]{1,2})?$\\|^-?(100)(\\.[0]{1,2})?$   |                                                              |\n| State abbreviation            | [A-Z][A-Z]                                             | You may choose to put spaces either before or after the regex. |\n| Phone Numbers                 | (^\\+[0-9]{2}\\|^\\+[0-9]{2}\\(0\\)\\|^\\(\\+[0-9]{2}\\)\\(0\\)\\|^00[0-9]{2}\\|^0)([0-9]{9}$\\|[0-9\\-\\s]{10}$) |                                                              |\n|                               | ^((\\+\\|00(\\s\\|\\s?\\-\\s?)?)31(\\s\\|\\s?\\-\\s?)?(\\(0\\)[\\-\\s]?)?\\|0)[1-9]((\\s\\|\\s?\\-\\s?)?[0-9])((\\s\\|\\s?-\\s?)?[0-9])((\\s\\|\\s?-\\s?)?[0-9])\\s?[0-9]\\s?[0-9]\\s?[0-9]\\s?[0-9]\\s?[0-9]$ | 06 1234567 or +31(06) 123 45678                              |\n| City, State abbreviation      | .*, [A-Z][A-Z]                                         |                                                              |\n| Zip Code                      | [0-9]\\{5\\}(-[0-9]\\{4\\})?

But you must be able to understand what is being performed in such an expression.\n\n# Cyber \n\n## Denial of service attack (ReDoS)\n\nA denial of service attack is when an attacker makes an online service slow down or become unavailable to its users. \n\nDenial-of-service for regular expressions (ReDoS) is a denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the fact that most implementations of regular expressions can get into extreme situations that make them work very slowly (exponentially depending on the input size). An attacker can use a [stripped down] regular expression to get a program into these extreme situations and then get stuck for a long time. \n\n### Evil Regex\n\nA regex pattern is known as a evil regex if it can get stuck in the generated input that is given.\n\nEvil regex contains :\n\n- Grouping with a lot of repetition\n- Inside of repetition group \n  - Again repetition (many nested repertitions)\n  - Alternation with overlapping\n\nsome examples \n\n- ```regex\n  ^(a+)+$\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  ([a-zA-Z]+)*\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|aa)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (a|a?)+\n  ```\n\n- ```regex\n  (.*a){x} for x \\> 10\n  ```\n\n- ``` regex\n  \\^([a-zA-Z0-9])(([\\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+))*(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})|([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$ \n  ```\n\n\nThese regex expressions are all sensitive to the string input:\n- \t\t\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar url = 'https://google.com/'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (url.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(url + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(url + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/ is a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2ms\n```\n\nBut now consider to apply the regular expression on a bad url introduced in our code by an attacker.\n\n```javascript\nvar validUrlRegex = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/\nvar badUrl = 'https://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@'\n\nconsole.time('regex evaluation time')\n\nif (badUrl.match(validUrlRegex)) {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is a valid url')\n} else {\n  console.log(badUrl + ' is not a valid url')\n}\n\nconsole.timeEnd('regex evaluation time')\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\nhttps://google.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@ is not a valid url\nregex evaluation time: 2196ms\n```\n\nAs you can observe, the evaluation time of regex has been increased by 1000 times by adding only 25 characters to previous url. Let's see why.\n\n__Fair warning, I actually managed to crash my computer when trying this out by giving a super long string as input._\n\n### The attack \n\n\n\n### Prevent This Vulnerability\n\nRecognizing evil regular expressions requires in-depth knowledge / experience with them. There are also tools to recognize these types of regular expressions. As a software-engineer you have to be vary careful when applying regular expressions in your code. Always have a limit on how many characters to accept from a input. Or use standard libraries to check certain expressions. \"Sanitize and filter user's inputs\" this is a rule valid also for other type of attacks. Since the attack can be originated from a input string, filter and sanitize it before to evaluate it to avoid unhandled errors or attacks.\n\n","readingTime":"7 min read","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1638882819267},"$loki":17},{"slug":"internship_cytosmart_gdpr","description":"summary about the implementation of the GDPR-CFR legislation that I have applied within the company CytoSMART.","id":null,"title":"GDPR","duration":"1 day","image":"./images/projects/internship/cytosmart/gdpr.jpg","tech":[{"name":"gdpr"},{"name":"annex 11"}],"category":[{"name":"minor"},{"name":"cyber"},{"name":"body of knowledge"},{"name":"software-engineering"},{"name":"internship"}],"author":{"name":"Rik Peeters","image":"/images/me.jpg","social":{"twitter":"rikp777"}},"toc":[{"id":"research","depth":2,"text":"Research"},{"id":"technologies","depth":3,"text":"Technologies"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"},{"id":"evaluation","depth":2,"text":"Evaluation"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-and-annex-11"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-and-annex-11","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Annex 11"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Annex 11 is the FDA 21 CFR part 11 European equivalent."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Title 21 Part 11 is the portion of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations that establishes the U.S. Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures (ERES) regulations.

Part 11, as it is commonly referred to, defines the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered reliable and equivalent to paper documents.\n\nInternship [@CytoSMART](https://cytosmart.com)\n\nThis report is about the internship I did at CytoSMART.\nCytoSMART is a young company whose aim is to offer products (equipment) for biomedical laboratories in as large a market as possible which is worldwide. This company therefore wants to take into account specific requirements and restrictions associated with sales on the international market as early as the development phase. For the development of equipment and software in the pharmaceutical industry, legislation has been created that sets criteria that a device/software must meet. This legislation is called FDA CFR 21 Part 11.\n\nCytoSMART has hired a total of 3 trainees,  which have been divided into different parts within the processing of the CFR 21 Part 11 legislation. The components are:  the Audit trail, the electronic signatures and the approval flow/user management. My part in this project will be the application of the  ”Audit trail”part, as stated in the FDA requirements CFR 21 Part 11, to the current software. The application must have a setting so that it can function according to the standards as described in legislation CFR 21 Part 11, but this setting must also be able to be turned off. The software had to be developed to be able to switch between these settings, on and off.\n\nThe technology used for the front-end consists of Vue.js with a back-end written in C#(ASP.NET), both of which have been made uniform to this  legislation. Previously, almost nothing had been adapted to the application, so that it would not comply with these guidelines as required by CytoSMART. However, after investigation, it was found that the software still met a number of these requirements.\n\nThe audit trail is incorporated in a visual GUI dashboard that is clear and legible for the user, with various functionalities such as export to a PDF format.  It is also possible to sort on different  levels. These levels can be subdivided into:  ”Company”,  ”User”, ”Entity\" and ”Action”.\n\nThe audit trail has been approved by CytoSMART and will be used in the future by various researchers for cell experiments. This was evident from the meeting that took place during the final delivery, the colleagues were also enthusiastic. In addition, the cooperation with the other trainees also went very well and we put together a lot of functionalities so that together they form a functional whole.\n\nI would advise CytoSMART to also implement the CFR functionalities for the other devices so that they can also offer them in the US. In addition, they can of course easily usethe audit trail module that I developed, which is very generic and modular in structure.\n\n## Research\n\nBased on the purpose of the project, a key research question can be created. This research question is as follows:\n\n```text \nHow can I accomplish the Audit-Trail within the application, and thus have it meet the requirements of the FDA as stated in CFR b?\n```\n\nTo answer the research question, I explored a few sub-topics in more detail. Important guideline in this, will be the steps that other companies in a similar path have already taken. This is because the aforementioned FDA requirements have been in place for some time. Therefore, I took a closer look at comparable companies that already have access to the market in the United States and already meet the requirements. It is therefore important to gain insight into how these companies have completed the validation process and thus obtained their approval. This therefore leads to the asking of the following questions:\n\nA brief summary of the research topics::\n\n- Implementation companies in the same sector\n- Audit trail structure\n- Efficiency database structure\n- Visualization\n- Form persistence\n- Retention period\n- Prerequisites\n- Whole Flow\n\nTo clarify the research topics, a description has been made for each topic, which zooms in even further. These research topics are further explained in the Process phases of the project. Also, the research topics are elaborated in the appendix \"research's document\" Research. From these findings, the first process phases within CytoSMART were started.

Between components within the monolithic architecture the communication is synchronised. For example the first component needs to communicate something to the second component. This interaction needs to be finished before the second component can interacted with the third component (otherwise it will get blocked).

Vertex is some kind of automation-platform which benefits the core businesses of the energy market. It develops tools, processes, statistical models, reports and full scale applications that efficiently supports the energy market businesses. \n\n## Team members  \n\nThe team consists of different departments that can provide expert support in multiple areas. If I would need support in, for example, the front-end, I could take my problems to this department. Also when I want technical information about a certain topic I can go to an expert within the company for this.

Also, there is attentive observation of what I as a trainee am doing and they help where necessary.\n\n## Guidance/Support\n\nWithin Energy Essentials Ralph Jansen is going to be my supervisor for this internship. He finished one study* that is ICT related which makes him a compatible supervisor. He meets the criterion given by the Fontys ICT exam board. He will be guiding me in person for a minimun of two hours a week but he will be on location as well for a minimun of 4 days a week if in any case I run into some issues, than he is there to help me out.

Thus they are indepent, they do not get blocked when a communication/interaction is not finished yet. \n\nCurrently Energy Essentials has a software called Vertex which consists out of monolithic architecture. With a structure like domain driven design CQRS even coursing aggregate root. \n\n## Problem and opportunity analysis \n\nEnergy Essentials wants to change the architecture of their Vertex software which is currently monolithic to cloud native architecture, also known as micro services. Their main reason to want to change the current architecture is to make the software solution more scalable. They need to change the way components interact with one another. At the moment they communicate in a synchronized matter (monolithic) but that needs to be changed into asynchronized (micro services). This transition poses different challenges. For example a micro service architecture needs a gateway that knows about all the instances which are the actual micro services. A gateway gives you as a client access to the software by redirecting you to the right service and instance, it is basically the entry point into the system. There are different frameworks for a gateway solution so my job in this project is to find the one that fits the best for this problem. To find the right one I need to do some research first.  \n\nThere are also some things to take in consideration when you want to change a software to a microservice architecture:\n\n- security\n\n- robustness resiliency testing\n\n- debugging\n\n- versioning\n\n\n## Purpose of the project\n\nThe purpose of  this project became pretty clear when I visited the company for the first time in person. Yorick and Justin introduced me to their idea for my internship. They want to change their current architecture which is monolithic to a cloud native one. Their reason to do this is because cloud native is way more flexible, scalable, resilient and less prone to problems. Monolithic architecture is a little bit out dated and does not fit their current solution any longer so they would prefer a cloud native architecture. An architecture like this is better for a bigger company and ofcourse, Energy Essentials is a lot bigger now than when they started. \n\nTo help me understand the assignment of this internship they had to explain the functionalities and architecture of the current software which is called Vertex. My key purpose is to change the current Vertex architecture (monolithic) into cloud native architecture. As stated above being cloud native has multiple advantages. If, for example, one of the modules fail for whatever reason the other modules will still keep working which means high availability for their users/customers.    \n\n## Research\n\nTo lead this project to a good end I have to do some research first. I need to get a clear view about what to do and how to achieve this. Therefore it is important learn more about microservice architecture and what is involved in a transition to a microservice like architecture. Lately, many companies are changing their architecture to microservice so I think looking at how other companies achieved this transition will give me pretty good idea about how I can make this change for Energy Essentials. \n\n### Research questions \n\n***How to convert monolithic architecture to cloud native solution?*** *\n\nWhich cloud native solution is the best for Energy Essentials? \n\nWhat is the difference between cloud native and microservice? \n\nHow to make the transition from synchronous to asychronous? \n\nWhat did other companies do to achieve the same goal? (look for relevant examples)\n\n\n\n*this means everything involved in the transition to convert from monolith to microservice architecture\n\n# Organization \n\n## Description \n\n[Energy Essentials](https://www.energyessentials.nl/) develops a software called Vertex for the energy/utilities market. Vertex is some kind of automation-platform which benefits the core businesses of the energy market. It develops tools, processes, statistical models, reports and full scale applications that efficiently supports the energy market businesses. \n\n## Team members  \n\nThe team consists of different departments that can provide expert support in multiple areas. If I would need support in, for example, the front-end, I could take my problems to this department. Also when I want technical information about a certain topic I can go to an expert within the company for this. All employees have graduated from both HBO or University in their specialization, and some have expanded their focus in several directions. Also, there is attentive observation of what I as a trainee am doing and they help where necessary.\n\n## Guidance/Support\n\nWithin Energy Essentials Ralph Jansen is going to be my supervisor for this internship. He finished one study* that is ICT related which makes him a compatible supervisor. He meets the criterion given by the Fontys ICT exam board. He will be guiding me in person for a minimun of two hours a week but he will be on location as well for a minimun of 4 days a week if in any case I run into some issues, than he is there to help me out. Ralph will also be the contact person for Fontys, his information can be found at the beginning of the document. \n\n*Zuyd Hogeschool | University of Applied Sciences \n\n# Personal Development Goals \n\nBecause my personal development is also very important, during my internship I will work on a number of personal learning goals in order to work on my professionalism. Below is a brief description of the learning objectives I want to work on.\n\n- Improve my English. I want to see if I can write this internship report without problems since it is a little bit of a challenge for me to write it fully in English. \n\n- Writing in a professional matter is difficult for me so I want to improve this. I find it difficult to get my ideas out on paper. Maybe this is due to my dyslexia but nevertheless I want to improve this skill because this is important for any further studies. \n\n- Applying techniques that I have learned during my studies at Fontys on situations in the real business world. I want to get hands-on experience with the things I learned during my studies since this is also really important once I finish my studies so I will be confident enough in my quality of work. \n\n- Accepting flaws within an architectural design. Sometimes when I need to work on a software I get frustrated by the way it is build even if it does not interfere with what I need to work on within the software. I always have the urge to rewrite the whole architecture but this is not needed since the software works for the given solution. \n\n\n\n\n","readingTime":"8 min
